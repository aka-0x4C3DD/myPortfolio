HackThisSite.org (HTS) is a popular online platform that provides a safe and legal environment for aspiring hackers to test and develop their skills in penetration testing, web security, and ethical hacking. The platform features a variety of challenges, ranging from basic to advanced levels, aimed at teaching critical aspects of cybersecurity. 

### Overview of HackThisSite.org

HackThisSite.org was created to teach the fundamentals of hacking while promoting ethical behavior. It emphasizes the responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities and focuses on helping users understand the importance of securing systems and networks. The website provides hands-on training with real-world hacking scenarios and has a strong community that encourages learning and collaboration.

In this report, we'll explore the **Basic Challenges** section of HackThisSite.org, detailing the objectives, methodologies, and solutions for each challenge. The **Basic Challenges** focus primarily on web-based vulnerabilities, teaching users about HTML, JavaScript, cookies, and form manipulation.

### Basic Challenge 1: "The Idiot Test"
#### Objective:
This challenge introduces users to the simplest form of hacking: manipulating website source code. The goal is to find the password hidden in the HTML source.

#### Methodology:
1. **Understand the Challenge**: The webpage asks for a password, but no password is visible.
2. **View the Source Code**: Right-click anywhere on the webpage and select "View Page Source" (or use the browser’s developer tools).
3. **Inspect the HTML**: Within the HTML, search for any hidden fields or comments. Often, developers leave critical information in the source code for testing purposes, which can be exploited.
4. **Locate the Password**: In this case, the password is hardcoded in the source code as part of a comment or an input field.

#### Solution:
- The password is found in the HTML source, typically within a comment or hidden input field, revealing the string "password123".

#### Lesson Learned:
- This challenge teaches that inspecting a website's source code can reveal sensitive information left exposed by developers. Always avoid hardcoding sensitive data in publicly accessible code.

### Basic Challenge 2: "Password with Javascript"
#### Objective:
Here, users are expected to bypass a JavaScript-based password check to gain access.

#### Methodology:
1. **Understand the Challenge**: A JavaScript function verifies the entered password. Users need to bypass or manipulate this verification.
2. **Inspect the JavaScript**: Use browser tools (like the "Inspector" or "Console") to view the JavaScript code. In some cases, the script is embedded directly in the HTML.
3. **Analyze the Code**: Look for the part of the JavaScript code that checks the password. Often, the password is directly visible in the code or can be deduced from the logic.
4. **Modify the Script**: You can either read the password from the code or manipulate the script in the browser console to bypass the check.

#### Solution:
- The password is hardcoded in the JavaScript code, usually something like "letmein".

#### Lesson Learned:
- JavaScript client-side validation is not secure because anyone can view or modify the code. Sensitive operations, such as password checks, should always be done server-side.

### Basic Challenge 3: "Return to Sender"
#### Objective:
Users are tasked with exploiting the form's input fields to gain unauthorized access. The challenge highlights the dangers of insecure form submissions.

#### Methodology:
1. **Understand the Challenge**: The page provides a form where the user is expected to enter a password.
2. **Manipulate the Form**: Use browser developer tools to modify the form's attributes. Look for hidden input fields or scripts that manipulate form submission data.
3. **Send a Custom Request**: By altering form values or sending a custom HTTP request with tools like Burp Suite or a simple browser console, you can bypass the form's security checks.

#### Solution:
- Inspect the form elements and adjust the parameters being sent to the server. The hidden form input may reveal the expected password.

#### Lesson Learned:
- Insecure handling of form data can be easily exploited. Developers should ensure that input validation occurs on the server side and that hidden fields do not expose sensitive information.

### Basic Challenge 4: "Poor Form"
#### Objective:
In this challenge, users must find a way to bypass form validation by manipulating the form's action URL or parameters.

#### Methodology:
1. **Understand the Challenge**: The page features a form with client-side validation, and the user must bypass this.
2. **Inspect the Form**: Use browser tools to examine the form’s action and method. The action URL may reveal clues about how the server processes the request.
3. **Submit a Custom Form**: Tools like `curl` or browser developer consoles can be used to alter the form data and submit it in a way that bypasses the client-side validation.

#### Solution:
- Submit a custom HTTP request, bypassing any client-side validation, to the correct URL endpoint.

#### Lesson Learned:
- Relying solely on client-side validation for security is a major mistake. Form submissions should be validated and sanitized server-side to prevent unauthorized access.

### Basic Challenge 5: "The Password is in the Cookies"
#### Objective:
This challenge involves bypassing authentication by manipulating cookies.

#### Methodology:
1. **Understand the Challenge**: The user is authenticated based on cookie values. The objective is to manipulate the cookie to gain access.
2. **Inspect the Cookies**: Use browser tools to inspect cookies stored by the website. Look for values that seem related to authentication, such as user roles or session identifiers.
3. **Modify the Cookies**: Change the values of the cookies directly using browser tools or interceptors like Burp Suite to simulate different credentials or elevated privileges.

#### Solution:
- The password or user credentials are stored in the cookies. By altering the cookie values (like changing `role=guest` to `role=admin`), the user can gain unauthorized access.

#### Lesson Learned:
- Storing sensitive information in cookies is a security risk. Always encrypt cookie data and ensure that critical authentication is managed on the server-side, not by trusting client-side cookies.

### Basic Challenge 6: "Are You Listening?"
#### Objective:
This challenge involves basic packet sniffing or using tools like Wireshark to intercept and analyze network traffic.

#### Methodology:
1. **Understand the Challenge**: You are tasked with listening in on communication to intercept a password.
2. **Set Up a Packet Sniffer**: Use a tool like Wireshark to capture traffic between the client and server. Look for unencrypted HTTP traffic where sensitive information may be transmitted in plain text.
3. **Extract the Password**: Filter the captured packets for HTTP POST or GET requests where the password may be sent.

#### Solution:
- Analyze the intercepted traffic to find the password being transmitted in plain text over HTTP.

#### Lesson Learned:
- Transmitting sensitive information over unencrypted channels (like HTTP instead of HTTPS) is a significant security flaw. Always use encrypted connections (SSL/TLS) to protect sensitive data.

### Basic Challenge 7: "JavaScript Cookies"
#### Objective:
This challenge involves exploiting JavaScript and cookies to retrieve the password.

#### Methodology:
1. **Understand the Challenge**: The webpage uses JavaScript to store or process cookies for authentication.
2. **Inspect the JavaScript and Cookies**: Look at the JavaScript code related to cookies. Often, the password or relevant information is stored in a cookie or is obfuscated but can be decoded.
3. **Modify the Cookie**: Using the browser’s developer tools, modify or decode the cookie to gain access.

#### Solution:
- The cookie contains the password in an encoded form. Decode the cookie to retrieve the password, and then enter it into the form.

#### Lesson Learned:
- Never store sensitive information in cookies in plain or easily reversible forms. Use server-side session management and encryption to secure session data.
