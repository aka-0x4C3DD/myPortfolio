1. Best Practices from ACSC

Australian Cyber Security Centre (ACSC) website Common best practices include:

    Use passphrases rather than single-word passwords (e.g., "correct-horse-battery-staple").
    Ensure passwords are at least 14 characters long.
    Avoid easily guessable information (like birthdays or names).
    Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for additional security.
    Use unique passwords for each account.
    Store passwords securely (using a password manager).

2. Simple & Clear Visuals

Use icons and illustrations to depict key concepts like:

    A lock for security.
    A shield for protection (symbolizing MFA).
    A notebook with dots (for password managers).
    A person thinking (for remembering passwords).

3. Key Points to Include (Based on ACSC Advice)

    Use Passphrases: Create long and memorable passphrases by combining unrelated words.
    Enable MFA: Always turn on multi-factor authentication for important accounts.
    Unique for Each Account: Never reuse passwords across multiple services.
    Use a Password Manager: Store and manage your passwords securely in an encrypted vault.
    Avoid Predictable Passwords: Don't use your name, birth date, or common phrases.

4. Tips on Managing Passwords

    Change passwords periodically, especially if there's a security breach.
    Use a password manager to avoid the need to memorize multiple passwords.
    Educate about the risks of saving passwords in browsers.

5. Design

    Color Palette: Use a color palette that aligns with your companyâ€™s branding and is easy on the eyes (e.g., blue for trust, green for safety).
    Layout: Organize information hierarchically, with headings, icons, and small chunks of text.
    Font: Use clean, legible fonts like Arial or Open Sans for readability.
