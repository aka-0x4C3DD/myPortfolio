00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.575
Congratulations! We
accomplished a lot together.

2
00:00:04.575 --> 00:00:06.585
Let's take time to
quickly go through

3
00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:08.760
all the new concepts we covered.

4
00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.190
We started this
course by focusing on

5
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.890
working with strings and lists.

6
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.945
We learned methods that work

7
00:00:15.945 --> 00:00:18.360
specifically with
these data types.

8
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.535
We also learned to work with

9
00:00:20.535 --> 00:00:23.460
indices and extract
information we need.

10
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.240
Next, we focused on
writing algorithms.

11
00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.940
We wrote a simple
algorithm that sliced

12
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.165
the network ID from a
list of IP addresses.

13
00:00:33.165 --> 00:00:37.385
Finally, we covered using
regular expressions.

14
00:00:37.385 --> 00:00:41.450
Regular expressions allow
you to search for patterns,

15
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.790
and this provides
expanded ways to

16
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.000
locate what you need in
logs and other files.

17
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.730
These are complex concepts,
and you're always

18
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.835
welcome to visit the videos
again whenever you like.

19
00:00:52.835 --> 00:00:54.920
With these concepts, you took

20
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.840
a big step towards being able to

21
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.340
work with data and write

22
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.460
the algorithms that security
professionals need.

23
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.680
Throughout the rest
of this course,

24
00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.450
you're going to get
more practice with

25
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.660
Python and what it can
offer to security analysts.
