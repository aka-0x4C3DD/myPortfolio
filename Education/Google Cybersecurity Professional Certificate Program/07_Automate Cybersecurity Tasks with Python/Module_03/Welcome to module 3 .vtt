00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.685
As a security analyst,

2
00:00:02.685 --> 00:00:05.100
you'll work with a lot of data.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.560
Being able to develop
solutions for

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.350
managing this data
is very important.

5
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:11.820
What we're about to learn in

6
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.040
Python will help you with that.

7
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.840
Previously, we set

8
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:19.035
foundations for what we're
going to do in this section.

9
00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:22.635
We learned all about data
types and variables.

10
00:00:22.635 --> 00:00:26.400
We also covered conditional
and iterative statements.

11
00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:28.140
We learned about building

12
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.785
functions and even created
our own functions.

13
00:00:31.785 --> 00:00:35.820
Here, we'll build on that
in a few different ways.

14
00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.130
First, you'll learn more about

15
00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.800
working with strings and lists.

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.650
We'll expand the ways that you

17
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.630
can work with these data types,

18
00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:47.150
including extracting
characters from

19
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:49.760
strings or items from lists.

20
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.710
Our next focus is on
writing algorithms.

21
00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:57.050
You'll consider a set of
rules that can be applied in

22
00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.410
Python to solve a
security-related problem.

23
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.920
Finally, we'll further expand
the ways we can search

24
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.850
for strings when we explore
using regular expressions.

25
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.270
We're going to have a
lot of fun, and you'll

26
00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:13.210
start writing some really
interesting code in Python.

27
00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.940
I can't wait to get started.
