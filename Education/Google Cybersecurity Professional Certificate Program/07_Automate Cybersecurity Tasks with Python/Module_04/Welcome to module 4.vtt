00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.425
We've learned a lot about
Python together already,

2
00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:06.810
and we still have more to cover.

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.415
In this section,

4
00:00:08.415 --> 00:00:10.950
we're going to explore how
a security analyst like

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:13.950
yourself puts Python
into practice.

6
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:15.704
As a security analyst,

7
00:00:15.704 --> 00:00:18.540
you will likely work with
security logs that capture

8
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.690
information on various
system activities.

9
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.030
These logs are often very

10
00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:26.700
large and hard to
quickly interpret.

11
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.610
But Python can easily automate

12
00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:33.060
these tasks and make things
much more efficient.

13
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.025
So first, we'll focus

14
00:00:35.025 --> 00:00:37.650
on opening and reading
files in Python.

15
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.800
This includes log files.

16
00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.890
We'll then explore
parsing files.

17
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:46.790
This means you'll be able to
work with files in ways that

18
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.620
provide you with the
security-related

19
00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.155
information that
you're targeting.

20
00:00:51.155 --> 00:00:55.235
Finally, part of writing
code is debugging code.

21
00:00:55.235 --> 00:00:57.395
It's important to be
able to interpret

22
00:00:57.395 --> 00:00:59.510
error messages to
make your code work.

23
00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.670
We'll cover common types of

24
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.625
Python errors and
ways to resolve them.

25
00:01:05.625 --> 00:01:07.730
Overall, after completing
this section,

26
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:10.670
you'll have a better
understanding of Python and

27
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:14.015
how as a security
analyst you can use it.

28
00:01:14.015 --> 00:01:16.470
I can't wait to join you.
