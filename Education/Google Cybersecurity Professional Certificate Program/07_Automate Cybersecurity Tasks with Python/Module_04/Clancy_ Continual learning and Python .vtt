00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.980
My name is Clancy and I'm a
Senior Security Engineer.

2
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.390
My team here at
Google is part of

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:11.220
an ongoing effort to protect

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:15.195
Google's sensitive information,
customer data, PII.

5
00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:16.875
Everyday is different at my job,

6
00:00:16.875 --> 00:00:19.095
it allows me to use
different skills,

7
00:00:19.095 --> 00:00:21.315
knowledge sets, and
no day is alike.

8
00:00:21.315 --> 00:00:22.545
By trade, I am not

9
00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:25.140
a engineer or software
engineer at all.

10
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.300
I was actually in
accounting. Being

11
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.130
affected by any type of

12
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.200
cybersecurity attack
definitely gives

13
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.170
you a perspective on
the opposite side.

14
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.400
You get to see how
this affects users,

15
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.565
how this affects people
that were attacked.

16
00:00:38.565 --> 00:00:41.360
Had I known when I
first started out

17
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.140
how big of a field
cybersecurity really was,

18
00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:47.965
it would have allowed
me to explore.

19
00:00:47.965 --> 00:00:50.330
Python is a
developmental language.

20
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.260
I use it very frequently
at my role at Google.

21
00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.440
One of my favorite things about

22
00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:56.290
Python is the power
of the language.

23
00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:57.410
You can use it to create

24
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:58.670
very powerful scripts that

25
00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:00.055
you'll use in your
day-to-day role.

26
00:01:00.055 --> 00:01:01.355
When I first picked up Python,

27
00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:02.960
the trickiest part
was learning how to

28
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.580
say things the Pythonic way.

29
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:08.480
I used various resources
online as well as books,

30
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:10.615
as well as picking
up side projects.

31
00:01:10.615 --> 00:01:12.800
One of the best things
about Python it's

32
00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.020
a very widely used
language and you can find

33
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.020
many resources online
depending on your skill set.

34
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.535
Python, as well as

35
00:01:19.535 --> 00:01:22.370
any other developmental language,
is constantly evolving.

36
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:23.840
Continue to take on projects,

37
00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.595
continue to stretch
your knowledge

38
00:01:25.595 --> 00:01:27.155
and you'll continue to grow.

39
00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:29.750
The advice I can
give for a person

40
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.855
starting to learn
Python is make it fun.

41
00:01:32.855 --> 00:01:36.410
I think once you find a
learning a language to be fun,

42
00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:38.415
it allows you to
be more engaged.

43
00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:41.590
Develop a good baseline
for what cybersecurity is.

44
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:42.665
Make yourself a little

45
00:01:42.665 --> 00:01:45.380
well-rounded in the beginning
and then from there you

46
00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:46.970
can branch out and deep dive

47
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.095
into subjects that are
interesting to you.

48
00:01:50.095 --> 00:01:52.710
When starting out,
it can be very tough

49
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.045
and you feel as if you're
climbing up a big hill.

50
00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:58.520
Persevere, continue to learn

51
00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.380
and it will be a very
rewarding experience.
