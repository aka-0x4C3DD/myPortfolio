00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:05.400
My name is Matt.

2
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:08.980
I'm a software engineer
working in cybersecurity.

3
00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.755
When I was in high school,

4
00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:12.660
what I really want
to do is music,

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.250
I was a musician.

6
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.880
I went to music school
for jazz trombone.

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.045
Partway through that
process, I realized, no,

8
00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:23.265
bandleader in their right mind,

9
00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:25.245
looks at a group and thinks,

10
00:00:25.245 --> 00:00:27.075
we need a trombone player.

11
00:00:27.075 --> 00:00:28.905
This is what makes us better.

12
00:00:28.905 --> 00:00:35.375
I grew up watching
movies like The Matrix,

13
00:00:35.375 --> 00:00:38.180
and it's not very

14
00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.565
realistic to what cybersecurity
work actually is,

15
00:00:40.565 --> 00:00:42.215
but it is inspiring.

16
00:00:42.215 --> 00:00:44.330
If you dig through the work

17
00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:46.460
at specifics of what
you do and take

18
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.485
the broad step back like you are

19
00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:52.030
that cool guy with
sunglasses, you're a hacker.

20
00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.920
When I first started
writing code,

21
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.675
I would look at coding errors

22
00:00:56.675 --> 00:00:59.135
as a sign that I have done bad.

23
00:00:59.135 --> 00:01:01.145
But as I grew older,

24
00:01:01.145 --> 00:01:02.435
a little bit more mature,

25
00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:05.130
I realized everyone
has coding errors.

26
00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.170
Literally the very best
software engineer I

27
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.475
know writes code
and it has errors.

28
00:01:09.475 --> 00:01:12.260
Errors represent a moment where

29
00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.260
you can take a step back and
say, what did I do wrong?

30
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:16.840
It's a learning opportunity.

31
00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.440
Now, I see these
like moments where

32
00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.690
I can look at some
problems that I don't

33
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.120
understand and be like, why?

34
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.205
Dive into it and expand

35
00:01:28.205 --> 00:01:32.305
my knowledge of computer
science, which is my whole job.

36
00:01:32.305 --> 00:01:34.190
I see this as a learning

37
00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:36.160
process and it's
a little bit fun.

38
00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:40.805
One of the really messy coding
areas that I've run into

39
00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:45.230
in my time here at Google
involved fingerprinting

40
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:47.050
when we find a vulnerability.

41
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.595
If we find the same
vulnerability later,

42
00:01:49.595 --> 00:01:52.310
we don't want to have
two vulnerabilities,

43
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.470
we don't want to poke
someone twice and be like,

44
00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.765
fix this thing if it's
the exact same thing.

45
00:01:56.765 --> 00:01:58.430
We do this thing called

46
00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:01.100
fingerprinting where we
say this vulnerability has

47
00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.575
a specific fingerprint
and if we find

48
00:02:03.575 --> 00:02:06.320
another vulnerability that
has the same fingerprint,

49
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.640
we're not going to store them

50
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.410
separately or treat
them separately.

51
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:10.705
They're effectively the same.

52
00:02:10.705 --> 00:02:13.160
I was running into these errors

53
00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.660
where things would not

54
00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.650
fingerprint in the way
that I expected them to.

55
00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:21.455
I was literally grinding
my gears for weeks,

56
00:02:21.455 --> 00:02:22.955
trying to figure out what

57
00:02:22.955 --> 00:02:24.335
is going on with this thing?

58
00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:28.345
But when I found it was very
satisfying like, that's it.

59
00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:30.650
When you're in the
middle of this mess,

60
00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:32.900
all of that self-doubt
creeps into your brain.

61
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.670
You're like, maybe I'm

62
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.920
not as good at this thing
as I thought I was.

63
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.500
What I would go back and

64
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.795
tell myself: A), it's not endless -

65
00:02:42.795 --> 00:02:44.750
it gets better. Once
you figure it out,

66
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.315
that feeling of
reward is incredible.

67
00:02:47.315 --> 00:02:50.720
But B), also, it's okay
to rope people in

68
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:52.870
if you are struggling
with something,

69
00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.195
I always advocate
for asking for help.

70
00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:57.920
Most people are really

71
00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.645
excited to go help you
out with this thing,

72
00:02:59.645 --> 00:03:02.185
especially when it's
a convoluted problem.

73
00:03:02.185 --> 00:03:06.305
I am so thrilled I ended
up in cybersecurity.

74
00:03:06.305 --> 00:03:08.130
Cybersecurity is
having its moment.

75
00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:11.165
People are realizing, waking
up to the amount of data

76
00:03:11.165 --> 00:03:12.290
that they're putting out into

77
00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:14.755
the world and they're
starting to care about it.

78
00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:16.845
Every day there's something new.

79
00:03:16.845 --> 00:03:19.320
Every day there's something

80
00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:21.990
exciting for me to do and yeah,

81
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:24.670
get into it.
Cybersecurity is the way.
