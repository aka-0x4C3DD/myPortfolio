00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.970
Great work in this section!

2
00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.030
We focused on a few new
topics that will help

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:09.375
you put Python into practice
in the security profession.

4
00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:14.265
First, we explored opening
and reading files in Python.

5
00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:18.060
Security analysts work
with a lot of log files,

6
00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:21.525
so the ability to do
this is essential.

7
00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:25.200
Next, we covered parsing files.

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.645
Log files can be very long.

9
00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:29.820
For this reason, a structure

10
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.530
in these files to make them more

11
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.600
readable helps you automate

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.720
your tasks and get the
information you need.

13
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:39.705
And last, we focused
on debugging code.

14
00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.150
Knowing how to debug

15
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.525
your code can save
you a lot of time,

16
00:00:43.525 --> 00:00:47.200
especially as your code
increases in complexity.

17
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.370
Overall, I hope you feel

18
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.070
proud of what you've
accomplished in this section.

19
00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:54.710
Addressing security
issues through Python is

20
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.570
exciting, and the information we

21
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:59.700
covered will allow
you to do that.
