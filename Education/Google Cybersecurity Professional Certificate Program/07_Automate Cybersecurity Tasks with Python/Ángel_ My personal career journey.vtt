00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.875
My name is Ángel, and I'm a
Security Engineer at Google.

2
00:00:07.875 --> 00:00:09.435
There were a number of things in

3
00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:12.944
my life that led me to security.

4
00:00:12.944 --> 00:00:15.269
One of them was definitely

5
00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:16.960
curiosity when I was growing up.

6
00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.905
My parents are accountants,
and so they had

7
00:00:19.905 --> 00:00:23.940
pocket calculators and
mechanical pencils and pens.

8
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.120
And I was always
breaking them up and

9
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:27.500
taking pieces apart and

10
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:28.940
trying to figure
out how they work.

11
00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.305
This led me to
technology in general,

12
00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:34.265
and the same concept
applied again—just

13
00:00:34.265 --> 00:00:35.510
trying to figure out how

14
00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.235
things work and breaking them.

15
00:00:37.235 --> 00:00:39.630
That's basically what
security's trying to do:

16
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:41.720
breaking things to
figure out whether or

17
00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:44.335
not somebody else could
break them before you do.

18
00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:47.025
I started as a network engineer.

19
00:00:47.025 --> 00:00:49.640
This was setting up firewalls,

20
00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.240
setting up switches and routers
for different companies.

21
00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:56.660
I wanted to join cybersecurity
mostly because I felt

22
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.550
very motivated about the things

23
00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:00.260
that were going on
in the industry.

24
00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:01.985
Project Aurora was Google

25
00:01:01.985 --> 00:01:03.890
getting hacked by
a foreign actor.

26
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.975
I was reading this
and I was thinking,

27
00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:07.460
"I wish I could work with

28
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.055
the people that are working
on this on the front lines."

29
00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:12.290
When I was starting to get into

30
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.550
cybersecurity and I wanted
to make a jump in my career,

31
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:18.400
what I wanted to learn,
where I needed to be.

32
00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:21.455
One example is learning
automation through Python.

33
00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:23.195
I took online classes,

34
00:01:23.195 --> 00:01:26.735
I completed certifications—security
certifications,

35
00:01:26.735 --> 00:01:28.085
very popular ones—and

36
00:01:28.085 --> 00:01:30.095
then I just started to

37
00:01:30.095 --> 00:01:33.815
incorporate some of these
aspects into my current job.

38
00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:37.775
When I was moving from Mexico
to the U.S. to work here,

39
00:01:37.775 --> 00:01:41.840
I had to learn how
to be flexible.

40
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.790
You have to learn new things

41
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.440
in order to advance your career.

42
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.450
Sometimes even you have to learn

43
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:50.965
new things just to stay
at the same spot you are.

44
00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:53.660
In security, I think
in all of technology,

45
00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:54.995
but especially in security,

46
00:01:54.995 --> 00:01:57.245
you constantly have
to reinvent yourself,

47
00:01:57.245 --> 00:01:58.940
keep learning how things work,

48
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.955
and keep learning how you
can help the industry.

49
00:02:02.955 --> 00:02:05.990
One important skill throughout
my life and in my career

50
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.055
as a cybersecurity
professional is resiliency.

51
00:02:10.055 --> 00:02:14.510
I learned a lot about resiliency
when I first moved here in

52
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:19.645
the U.S. and things didn't go
the way I expected them to,

53
00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:22.070
and I have to keep trying

54
00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.295
new things and
hope for the best.

55
00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:28.190
And that is really no different

56
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.720
from what we do as
security professionals.

57
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.925
We do this on a
day-to-day basis.

58
00:02:34.925 --> 00:02:39.755
We have to either figure out
ways to make things work,

59
00:02:39.755 --> 00:02:42.320
we have to figure
out ways to make

60
00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:45.545
projects function the
way we need them to,

61
00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:49.220
or we have to figure out
ways to get past a problem.

62
00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:51.110
We need more professionals in

63
00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.705
cybersecurity with
different backgrounds,

64
00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:56.255
and that means
different experiences,

65
00:02:56.255 --> 00:02:58.325
different ways of seeing things,

66
00:02:58.325 --> 00:03:01.550
different ways of approaching
and solving problems.

67
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:06.120
We need more people like
you in this industry.
