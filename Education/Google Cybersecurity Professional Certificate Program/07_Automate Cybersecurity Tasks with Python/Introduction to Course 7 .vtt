00:00:00.947 --> 00:00:04.941
The demand for security
professionals has never been higher.

2
00:00:04.941 --> 00:00:09.319
Organizations across the world require
professionals with your knowledge and

3
00:00:09.319 --> 00:00:12.268
skills to protect their
systems from attackers.

4
00:00:12.268 --> 00:00:15.076
And with the number of
threats on the rise,

5
00:00:15.076 --> 00:00:19.214
security professionals often
perform a diverse set of tasks.

6
00:00:19.214 --> 00:00:19.798
It's for

7
00:00:19.798 --> 00:00:24.775
this reason that we'll incorporate another
tool as part of our security toolbox.

8
00:00:24.775 --> 00:00:28.714
A tool that can simplify
many common security tasks.

9
00:00:28.714 --> 00:00:33.003
A tool that's used not only
by security professionals but

10
00:00:33.003 --> 00:00:37.657
also by engineers and
data scientists. That tool is Python.

11
00:00:38.657 --> 00:00:42.597
Hi there! Congratulations on getting to
the next step in your security journey.

12
00:00:42.597 --> 00:00:46.744
My name is Angel, and
I am a Security Engineer at Google.

13
00:00:46.744 --> 00:00:50.329
I'm excited to be joining
you in this course.

14
00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:54.760
If you've been following along
sequentially, you've already applied

15
00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.335
the specific tools that security
professionals use during the detection,

16
00:00:59.335 --> 00:01:01.636
analysis, and response processes.

17
00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:06.641
And you also learned how to communicate
with your computer through Linux and SQL.

18
00:01:06.641 --> 00:01:11.126
Now, we'll focus on how programming
in Python can be used for

19
00:01:11.126 --> 00:01:13.289
some common security tasks.

20
00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:15.935
As you consider your next career step,

21
00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:20.677
you might find that Python skills
will help you in your everyday work.

22
00:01:20.677 --> 00:01:25.376
This course is designed for
learning Python, starting with the basics.

23
00:01:25.376 --> 00:01:28.484
Then you'll gradually
build on those basics and

24
00:01:28.484 --> 00:01:33.892
apply what you learn to gain hands-on
practice with security-related examples.

25
00:01:33.892 --> 00:01:37.941
Fortunately, Python is known for
its readability. And

26
00:01:37.941 --> 00:01:42.257
just like all languages,
it will get easier with practice.

27
00:01:42.257 --> 00:01:47.167
Pretty soon, you might be using
Python in your security career.

28
00:01:47.167 --> 00:01:53.243
Python can automate the manual effort
of important tasks like file parsing.

29
00:01:54.243 --> 00:01:56.998
Python has helped me a lot
in my career here at Google.

30
00:01:56.998 --> 00:01:59.140
I am part of a team responsible for

31
00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:03.736
protecting Google's infrastructure,
which includes everything that

32
00:02:03.736 --> 00:02:08.725
employees useâ€”from laptops and desktops
to the network and cloud resources.

33
00:02:08.725 --> 00:02:12.024
We do this by engineering
security solutions and

34
00:02:12.024 --> 00:02:15.166
automating the repeatable
parts of our work.

35
00:02:15.166 --> 00:02:20.396
What I like about Python is that it has
cross-platform support, and a lot of tools

36
00:02:20.396 --> 00:02:25.878
have already been developed by members of
the security community that use Python.

37
00:02:25.878 --> 00:02:30.230
This makes it easy for me to find
the tools I need and get support with

38
00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.996
blockers so I can complete both my
professional and personal projects.

39
00:02:34.996 --> 00:02:38.605
My hope is that this course
will be helpful to you.

40
00:02:38.605 --> 00:02:40.362
Let's explore what we'll cover.

41
00:02:41.362 --> 00:02:44.246
First, you'll be introduced to basic
programming concepts in Python.

42
00:02:44.246 --> 00:02:48.452
You'll learn why Python has been adopted
by security professionals around

43
00:02:48.452 --> 00:02:49.117
the world.

44
00:02:49.117 --> 00:02:52.305
You will also develop and
run your first program.

45
00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:56.784
After this, we'll focus on
writing effective Python code.

46
00:02:56.784 --> 00:03:01.113
We'll discuss concepts that help
make our work more efficient.

47
00:03:01.113 --> 00:03:05.255
Our next main topic is on
working with strings and lists.

48
00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:09.938
These will be relevant to a lot of the
data that you will encounter in a security

49
00:03:09.938 --> 00:03:10.597
context.

50
00:03:10.597 --> 00:03:11.534
And finally,

51
00:03:11.534 --> 00:03:16.543
you'll wrap up the course with an exploration
of putting Python into practice.

52
00:03:16.543 --> 00:03:21.245
You'll learn about opening and
parsing files and about debugging code.

53
00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:25.042
Python is certainly a useful skill for
security analysts.

54
00:03:25.042 --> 00:03:25.991
Let's get started.
