00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:02.230
Hello again!

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:05.523
Previously, we learned about
built-in functions in Python.

3
00:00:05.523 --> 00:00:10.631
Built-in functions come standard
with every version of Python and

4
00:00:10.631 --> 00:00:15.750
consist of functions such as print(),
type(), max(), and many more.

5
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.940
To access additional pre-built functions,
you can import a library.

6
00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.474
A library is a collection of
modules that provide code users can

7
00:00:24.474 --> 00:00:26.460
access in their programs.

8
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.060
All libraries are generally
made up of several modules.

9
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:36.243
A module is a Python file that
contains additional functions,

10
00:00:36.243 --> 00:00:41.140
variables, classes, and
any kind of runnable code.

11
00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:47.050
Think of them as saved Python files
that contain useful functionality.

12
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.386
Modules may be made up of small and
simple lines of code or

13
00:00:51.386 --> 00:00:54.360
be complex and lengthy in size.

14
00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:00.260
Either way, they help save programmers
time and make code more readable.

15
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.760
Now, let's focus specifically
on the Python Standard Library.

16
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:10.122
The Python Standard Library
is an extensive collection of

17
00:01:10.122 --> 00:01:15.390
usable Python code that often
comes packaged with Python.

18
00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:20.743
One example of a module from the Python
Standard Library is the re module.

19
00:01:20.743 --> 00:01:22.645
This is a useful module for

20
00:01:22.645 --> 00:01:29.300
a security analyst when they're tasked
with searching for patterns in log files.

21
00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:32.310
Another module is the csv module.

22
00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:36.490
It allows you to work
efficiently with CSV files.

23
00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.797
The Python Standard Library also
contains glob and os modules for

24
00:01:41.797 --> 00:01:46.043
interacting with the command
line as well as time and

25
00:01:46.043 --> 00:01:50.250
datetime for working with timestamps.

26
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.720
These are just a few of the modules
in the Python Standard Library.

27
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:59.599
In addition to what's always available
through the Python Standard Library,

28
00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:02.320
you can also download external libraries.

29
00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:08.538
A couple of examples are Beautiful Soup
for parsing HTML website files and

30
00:02:08.538 --> 00:02:13.540
NumPy for arrays and
mathematical computations.

31
00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.326
These libraries will assist you
as a security analyst in network

32
00:02:18.326 --> 00:02:23.250
traffic analysis,
log file parsing, and complex math.

33
00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:25.229
Overall, Python libraries and

34
00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:30.520
modules are useful because they provide
pre-programmed functions and variables.

35
00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.320
This saves time for the user.

36
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:38.402
I encourage you to explore some of the
libraries and modules we discussed here and

37
00:02:38.402 --> 00:02:42.181
the ways they might be helpful
to you as you work in Python.
