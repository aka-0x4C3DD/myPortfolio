00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.250
Welcome back to our
Python journey!

2
00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.630
In the previous videos,

3
00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.400
we learned all about
the basics of Python.

4
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.880
We started at the
very beginning by

5
00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.615
understanding how security
analysts use Python.

6
00:00:13.615 --> 00:00:16.840
We learned several
building blocks of Python.

7
00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.485
We went into detail
learning about data types,

8
00:00:20.485 --> 00:00:23.165
variables, and basic statements.

9
00:00:23.165 --> 00:00:26.155
Now, we'll add to this and learn

10
00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:29.860
more about how to write
effective Python scripts.

11
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.005
We'll discover ways we can make

12
00:00:32.005 --> 00:00:34.295
our efforts more efficient.

13
00:00:35.295 --> 00:00:37.750
The upcoming videos are going
to start by introducing

14
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:41.410
functions, which are very
important in Python.

15
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.855
Functions allow us to
put together a set

16
00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:46.550
of instructions that we can use

17
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:48.595
again and again in our code.

18
00:00:48.595 --> 00:00:50.900
Afterwards, we're going to learn

19
00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:53.269
about Python modules
and libraries,

20
00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.040
which include collections of

21
00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:58.330
functions and data types
that we can use with Python.

22
00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:00.080
They help us gain access to

23
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.685
functions without having
to create them ourselves.

24
00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:06.335
Lastly, we're going
to talk about

25
00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:09.049
one of the most important
rules of programming,

26
00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:11.150
and that is code readability.

27
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.880
We'll learn all
about ways to make

28
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.765
sure everyone can understand
and work with your code.

29
00:01:18.765 --> 00:01:19.790
I'm excited that you've

30
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:22.460
decided to continue your
Python journey with me,

31
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.560
so let's start learning more!
