Hi, my name is Dorsa and
I'm a security engineer.

2
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.195
What I love the
most about my job

3
00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:10.260
is that I get to look at

4
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.675
different infrastructures
and system designs

5
00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:14.415
on a daily basis.

6
00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:16.590
One piece of advice for
individuals who are

7
00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.215
starting out in their
cybersecurity profession,

8
00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:20.640
it's very important to work

9
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.150
collaboratively in
Python and one of

10
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.250
the key aspects of
that is to listen

11
00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:27.605
to the feedback that your
team members provide.

12
00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:30.485
Python allows for
many different ways

13
00:00:30.485 --> 00:00:32.770
of accessing different
information.

14
00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.070
When you share Python code

15
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.825
snippets amongst
your team members,

16
00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:38.105
it allows the code
to be more uniform

17
00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:41.100
and the coding process
to be more efficient.

18
00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.560
It makes the code
base a lot more

19
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.180
readable and it allows for

20
00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.510
other engineers to work
on your code after you,

21
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.100
I've seen many examples of

22
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.500
when collaboratively
written Python code

23
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.390
has been helpful
in the industry.

24
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.790
One of the examples is
when at Google we wrote

25
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.030
a collaboratively written
code base which allowed

26
00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:01.760
for an onboarding
process to be reduced

27
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.790
from six or seven hours
to a couple of minutes.

28
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:08.630
Collaboration was a key part
of this process because

29
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.100
otherwise it would have taken

30
00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.310
many many years for one single
individual to write it.

31
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.290
One individual is not able to

32
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.765
understand every fine detail of

33
00:01:17.765 --> 00:01:19.970
each system and if we

34
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.715
don't have multiple
engineers working on it,

35
00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.460
they would have made this
process a lot more difficult.

36
00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.070
Communication is very important
when you're working in

37
00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:29.750
a team and especially

38
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.775
if you're developing
code in Python,

39
00:01:31.775 --> 00:01:33.200
you need to express

40
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.480
whether you need help
throughout the process

41
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.220
because your team
members are there to

42
00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:39.440
ensure that you are successful.

43
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.195
At the end of the
day, your success

44
00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:43.675
means that your team
is also successful.

45
00:01:43.675 --> 00:01:45.300
As you advance in your career

46
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.825
as someone who writes
code in Python,

47
00:01:47.825 --> 00:01:49.310
you'll realize that
there are a lot of

48
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.470
functions and methods
that are just sticking

49
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.600
around on the
internet and you will

50
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.035
be able to find them
with a quick search

51
00:01:56.035 --> 00:01:58.940
and those methods will
come in handy and you

52
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.240
will be able to reuse them
for your pieces of code.

53
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.580
A really good resource for you to

54
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.710
learn new skills and expand

55
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.720
your Python coding skills is to

56
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:10.940
talk to your colleagues,
attend meetups,

57
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.080
talk to different security

58
00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.460
professionals who don't work at

59
00:02:13.460 --> 00:02:15.380
your company because
everyone has

60
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.810
an insight on how to
make your coding skills,

61
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:21.000
especially in
cybersecurity better.
