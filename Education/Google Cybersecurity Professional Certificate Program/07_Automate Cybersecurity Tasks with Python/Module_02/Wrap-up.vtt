00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.065
Great work on making it this
far in the Python course!

2
00:00:04.065 --> 00:00:05.790
You've put in a lot of work and

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.500
effort towards
learning more about

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.340
how you can use Python
effectively and efficiently.

5
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.440
Let's quickly recap the concepts

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.315
you learned throughout the videos.

7
00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:17.520
First, we started by

8
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.100
understanding the role
of functions in Python.

9
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:22.305
They can save you a lot of time!

10
00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:24.615
You learned how to incorporate

11
00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:26.700
built-in functions and how to

12
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.775
develop your own function
to meet your needs.

13
00:00:29.775 --> 00:00:34.274
We then shifted our focus
towards modules and libraries,

14
00:00:34.274 --> 00:00:36.240
which gave us access to

15
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.090
a lot more functions than
those built into Python.

16
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.295
Lastly, we moved
to learning about

17
00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:45.650
code readability and
best practices to

18
00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:48.725
write clean,
understandable code.

19
00:00:49.725 --> 00:00:50.720
With these understandings,

20
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:52.775
you're ready to
learn how powerful

21
00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:56.060
Python can really be
for task automation and

22
00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:00.275
how it can help you going
forward as a security analyst.

23
00:01:00.275 --> 00:01:02.090
Thank you for taking the time

24
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.770
to go through this
course with me.

25
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.270
I'll meet you in
the next videos!
