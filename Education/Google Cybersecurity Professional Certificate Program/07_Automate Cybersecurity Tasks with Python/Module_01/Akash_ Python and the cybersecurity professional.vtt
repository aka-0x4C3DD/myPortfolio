00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.563
My name is Akash, and
I work as a Security Engineer at Google.

3
00:00:08.563 --> 00:00:13.030
As a cybersecurity engineer, you would end
up using Python for most of your career.

4
00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:15.338
It's very important that you learn Python.

5
00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:17.659
When you are moving into cybersecurity,

6
00:00:17.659 --> 00:00:21.636
you would be dealing with millions
of data points and things like that,

7
00:00:21.636 --> 00:00:25.170
which is going to be very hard for
you to go through manually.

8
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.999
So, that's when Python comes in to
automate and write scripts and

9
00:00:29.999 --> 00:00:34.770
small programs that will be able to
do the same thing in a split second.

10
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.936
Learning Python is super fun. When you
see like ten lines of code doing things

11
00:00:39.936 --> 00:00:45.780
like parsing through megabytes of data
within seconds, it can be very fulfilling.

12
00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.135
There's a lot of resources for Python,
and a lot of open-source communities, and

13
00:00:50.135 --> 00:00:51.490
the people are very helpful.

14
00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:55.030
Stay curious and
take up small problems and

15
00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.471
then get your hands
dirty with doing it and

16
00:00:58.471 --> 00:01:04.040
don't be afraid of looking up syntax and
learn online resources.

17
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:09.120
My job as a security engineer at
Google Chrome is to protect our customers

18
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.310
from foreign governments and
very persistent threats across the world.

19
00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.171
The threats are unlimited,
there's no limit to it, and

20
00:01:17.171 --> 00:01:19.750
that's what makes
cybersecurity very exciting.

21
00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:24.286
So, stick with it, it's an essential
skill that will take some time

22
00:01:24.286 --> 00:01:28.530
initially to develop but
will serve you throughout the career.
