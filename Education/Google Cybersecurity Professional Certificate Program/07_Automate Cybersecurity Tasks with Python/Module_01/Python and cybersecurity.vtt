00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.820
Security professionals
use a variety of tools.

2
00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:06.203
One of those tools is
computer programming.

3
00:00:06.203 --> 00:00:10.178
Programming is used to create
a specific set of instructions for

4
00:00:10.178 --> 00:00:12.027
a computer to execute tasks.

5
00:00:13.027 --> 00:00:15.029
Let's take an example
of a vending machine.

6
00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:21.223
Think of a vending machine as a computer
that supplies food or drinks to customers.

7
00:00:21.223 --> 00:00:26.529
To receive an item, the customer
inserts the money into the machine and

8
00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:28.928
then select the item they want.

9
00:00:28.928 --> 00:00:34.846
Let's say the customer provides
the machine with a value of $5.

10
00:00:34.846 --> 00:00:39.408
The machine stores this value
while you make your selection.

11
00:00:39.408 --> 00:00:43.013
If you select a candy bar that costs $2,

12
00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:48.884
the machine takes this input,
otherwise known as an instruction,

13
00:00:48.884 --> 00:00:54.714
and then understands to
output your candy bar for $2

14
00:00:54.714 --> 00:00:58.887
and provides the change back of $3.

15
00:00:59.887 --> 00:01:02.189
There are many programming
languages in existence.

16
00:01:02.189 --> 00:01:05.060
Here, we'll focus on Python.

17
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.402
Python is considered to be
a general-purpose language.

18
00:01:09.402 --> 00:01:14.827
This means that it can create
a variety of different programs, and

19
00:01:14.827 --> 00:01:19.851
it isn't a specialized in any
particular problem in fields

20
00:01:19.851 --> 00:01:24.588
such as web development and
artificial intelligence.

21
00:01:24.588 --> 00:01:30.950
Python is typically used to build websites
and perform data analysis.

22
00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:35.448
In security, the main reason we use Python
is to automate our tasks.

23
00:01:35.448 --> 00:01:39.557
Automation is the use of
technology to reduce human and

24
00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:43.771
manual effort to perform common and
repetitive tasks.

25
00:01:43.771 --> 00:01:48.764
Python is generally best for
automating short, simple tasks.

26
00:01:48.764 --> 00:01:53.545
For example, a security analyst
who's dealing with a security

27
00:01:53.545 --> 00:01:57.718
incident might have a log
with necessary information.

28
00:01:57.718 --> 00:02:01.968
Reading through these manually
would take too much time, but

29
00:02:01.968 --> 00:02:07.046
Python can help sort through this so
the analysts can find what they need.

30
00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:13.392
As another example, an analyst might use
Python to manage an access control list,

31
00:02:13.392 --> 00:02:18.576
the list that controls who can
access the system and its resources.

32
00:02:18.576 --> 00:02:22.416
It would be potentially less
consistent if the analysts had

33
00:02:22.416 --> 00:02:27.348
to manually remove an employee's access
every time they left the company.

34
00:02:27.348 --> 00:02:33.151
However, a Python program can
periodically monitor this instead. Or,

35
00:02:33.151 --> 00:02:39.840
Python could also perform some automated
tasks like analyzing network traffic.

36
00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.228
Though these tasks can be done
through outside applications,

37
00:02:44.228 --> 00:02:47.049
they are also possible through Python.

38
00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:50.276
In addition to automating
individual tasks,

39
00:02:50.276 --> 00:02:54.253
Python can combine separate
tasks into one workstream.

40
00:02:54.253 --> 00:03:00.021
For example, imagine a playbook indicates
that an analyst needs to resolve

41
00:03:00.021 --> 00:03:06.524
a certain situation by delivering a file
and then notifying the proper individuals.

42
00:03:06.524 --> 00:03:09.575
Python can connect these
processes together.

43
00:03:10.575 --> 00:03:15.746
So why exactly might a security professional
choose Python for these tasks?

44
00:03:15.746 --> 00:03:19.583
There are several advantages Python
has as a programming language.

45
00:03:19.583 --> 00:03:24.293
For one, Python is user-friendly
because it resembles human language,

46
00:03:24.293 --> 00:03:27.286
it requires less code, and
it's easy to read.

47
00:03:27.286 --> 00:03:32.384
Python programmers also have the benefit
of following standard guidelines

48
00:03:32.384 --> 00:03:36.695
to ensure consistency with the design and
readability of code.

49
00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:38.299
Another great reason for

50
00:03:38.299 --> 00:03:42.658
learning Python is that there's
a large amount of online support.

51
00:03:42.658 --> 00:03:47.649
Python also has an extensive collection
of built-in code that we can import and

52
00:03:47.649 --> 00:03:50.155
use to perform many different tasks.

53
00:03:50.155 --> 00:03:54.285
These are just some of the reasons why
Python continues to be in high demand

54
00:03:54.285 --> 00:03:57.285
across different industries
throughout the world.

55
00:03:57.285 --> 00:04:00.231
You'll most likely use it
in your security career.

56
00:04:01.231 --> 00:04:02.281
Wow! All of this sounds great.

57
00:04:02.281 --> 00:04:09.248
Let's take a short break, and next, we'll
finally get to run some Python code.

58
00:04:09.248 --> 00:04:10.821
I'll meet you in the next video.
