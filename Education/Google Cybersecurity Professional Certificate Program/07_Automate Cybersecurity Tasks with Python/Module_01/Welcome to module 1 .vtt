00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.010
The process of learning

2
00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:03.810
a new programming language is

3
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:05.820
similar to learning
a new language.

4
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.000
For instance, like
any human language,

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.625
programming consists of words

6
00:00:11.625 --> 00:00:14.655
organized together to
form lines of code.

7
00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:18.495
Lines of code are used to
communicate with a computer,

8
00:00:18.495 --> 00:00:20.384
similar to a sentence,

9
00:00:20.384 --> 00:00:22.875
telling it how to
perform a task.

10
00:00:22.875 --> 00:00:24.750
In this section, we're going to

11
00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:26.430
start learning the
language needed to

12
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.440
communicate with
a computer as we

13
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.735
explore some key
components of Python.

14
00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:33.720
We'll start by introducing
the basics of programming,

15
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.260
starting with why security
analysts use Python.

16
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.550
Next, we'll start building
the foundations for Python.

17
00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.860
We'll discuss data types.

18
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.575
Then we'll cover variables.

19
00:00:46.575 --> 00:00:49.160
Lastly, we're going
to learn about

20
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:51.320
specific statements
we can make in

21
00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:54.455
Python, like
conditional statements.

22
00:00:54.455 --> 00:00:56.780
Conditional statements help us

23
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.540
incorporate logic
into our programs.

24
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.830
The second type of
statement we'll learn

25
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.505
about is the
iterative statement.

26
00:01:04.505 --> 00:01:07.880
Iterative statements allow
us to repeat a line of

27
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:11.600
code multiple times without
having to rewrite it.

28
00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:13.940
Learning Python helped me

29
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.190
succeed in my career
because using

30
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.230
Python allows me to free up

31
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.900
time from repetitive
tasks, and instead,

32
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.950
focus on more challenging
tasks and problems.

33
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.490
Successfully applying

34
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.585
automation reduces
my overall workload,

35
00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:31.340
increases productivity,

36
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.950
and reduces the risk
of human error.

37
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.620
The use of automation
also allows

38
00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:39.040
me to focus on my
engineering tasks,

39
00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.195
which require more creativity,

40
00:01:41.195 --> 00:01:44.000
collaboration, and
problem-solving.

41
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.860
Are you ready to
start programming

42
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.780
in Python? Let's begin.
