00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.580
Well done!

2
00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:05.338
You've learned about why
security analysts use Python and

3
00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:07.440
the basic structure of a program.

4
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:11.041
You've even written some
lines of Python code.

5
00:00:12.041 --> 00:00:13.043
Let's review what you learned so far.

6
00:00:13.043 --> 00:00:16.312
You first learned about
the basics of programming and

7
00:00:16.312 --> 00:00:19.892
why it's a very important tool for
security analysts.

8
00:00:19.892 --> 00:00:23.548
You also learned some of the basic
concepts of how programming

9
00:00:23.548 --> 00:00:24.610
languages work.

10
00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.790
You then learned to recognize
data types in Python.

11
00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:33.020
We focused on string, integer,
float, Boolean, and list data.

12
00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.120
Next, we focused on
working with variables.

13
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.573
You then learned all about conditional
statements, and how to check for

14
00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:43.502
logical conditions using
Python statements.

15
00:00:43.502 --> 00:00:47.681
Lastly, we worked with
iterative statements and

16
00:00:47.681 --> 00:00:52.389
discussed the two types of loops:
for and while loops.

17
00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:56.565
You'll use this knowledge as you
progress through this course and

18
00:00:56.565 --> 00:00:58.874
in your career as a security analyst.

19
00:00:58.874 --> 00:01:02.748
In the next section, we'll explore
other important components of Python,

20
00:01:02.748 --> 00:01:03.948
including functions.
