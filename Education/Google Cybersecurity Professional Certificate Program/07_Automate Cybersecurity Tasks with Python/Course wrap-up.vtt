00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.655
As we wrap up this course,

2
00:00:02.655 --> 00:00:04.470
I want to congratulate you for

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.600
your commitment to
learning Python.

4
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:09.120
You should feel accomplished
having explored

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.725
a programming language that's

6
00:00:10.725 --> 00:00:12.480
useful in the security field.

7
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.850
Let's recap some of
what we've learned.

8
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.320
First, we covered basic
programming concepts in Python.

9
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.770
We discussed
variables, data types,

10
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:26.369
conditional statements,
and iterative statements.

11
00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.550
These topics provided
important foundations

12
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.220
for what we explored
later in the course.

13
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:36.645
And our next focus was on writing
effective Python code.

14
00:00:36.645 --> 00:00:39.210
We learned how we can
reuse functions in

15
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.009
our programs to
improve efficiency.

16
00:00:42.009 --> 00:00:45.110
We explored built-in
functions and even

17
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.470
created our own
user-defined functions.

18
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.530
Another topic was
modules and libraries.

19
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.220
The pre-packaged functions
and variables they

20
00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:58.145
contain can make
our work easier.

21
00:00:58.145 --> 00:01:03.320
Last, we learned ways to
ensure our code is readable.

22
00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.014
In the next section,

23
00:01:05.014 --> 00:01:08.330
we focused on working
with strings and lists.

24
00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.490
We learned a variety of

25
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:13.400
methods that can be
applied to these data types.

26
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:17.240
We also learned about their
indices and how to slice

27
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.005
characters from a string
or elements from a list.

28
00:01:21.005 --> 00:01:23.600
We put all of these together to

29
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.060
write a simple algorithm, and

30
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.785
then we explored how

31
00:01:27.785 --> 00:01:29.660
regular expressions can be used

32
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.095
to find patterns in the strings.

33
00:01:32.095 --> 00:01:34.790
And last, we wrapped
up the course with

34
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.400
a focus on putting
Python into practice.

35
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.530
We learned how to open,

36
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:41.810
read, and parse files.

37
00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.090
With these skills,
you can work with

38
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:45.320
a variety of logs you will

39
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.440
encounter in a security setting.

40
00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.950
We also learned
how to debug code.

41
00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:53.875
This is an important skill
for all programmers.

42
00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.735
Wow! You learned a lot

43
00:01:56.735 --> 00:01:59.825
about Python in this
course, so great job!

44
00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:02.180
I hope soon you'll join me in

45
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.735
using Python in the
security profession.

46
00:02:04.735 --> 00:02:07.250
In the meantime, I
encourage you to

47
00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.350
practice, and feel free to

48
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.095
rewatch these videos
whenever you like.

49
00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:14.480
The more you study
these concepts,

50
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:16.690
the easier they will become.

51
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.950
Thanks again for joining
me as we explored Python.
