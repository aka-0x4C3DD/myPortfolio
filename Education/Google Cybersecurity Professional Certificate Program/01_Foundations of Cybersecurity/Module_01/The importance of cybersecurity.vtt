00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.820
As we've discussed, security professionals
protect many physical and digital assets.

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.483
These skills are desired
by organizations and

3
00:00:09.483 --> 00:00:12.701
government entities because
risk needs to be managed.

4
00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:16.101
Let's continue to discuss
why security matters.

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.094
Security is essential for ensuring
an organization's business continuity and

6
00:00:22.094 --> 00:00:23.147
ethical standing.

7
00:00:23.147 --> 00:00:25.273
There are both legal implications and

8
00:00:25.273 --> 00:00:29.200
moral considerations to maintaining
an organization's security.

9
00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.925
A data breach, for example,

10
00:00:30.925 --> 00:00:35.140
affects everyone that is
associated with the organization.

11
00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:40.156
This is because data losses or leaks
can affect an organization's reputation

12
00:00:40.156 --> 00:00:45.210
as well as the lives and reputations
of their users, clients, and customers.

13
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:50.800
By maintaining strong security measures,
organizations can increase user trust.

14
00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.350
This may lead to financial growth and
ongoing business referrals.

15
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.023
As previously mentioned,

16
00:00:57.023 --> 00:01:01.321
organizations are not the only ones
that suffer during a data breach.

17
00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:04.304
Maintaining and
securing user, customer, and

18
00:01:04.304 --> 00:01:08.512
vendor data is an important part
of preventing incidents that may

19
00:01:08.512 --> 00:01:12.350
expose people's personally
identifiable information.

20
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:16.788
Personally identifiable
information, known as PII, is any

21
00:01:16.788 --> 00:01:21.140
information used to infer
an individual's identity.

22
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.651
PII includes someone's full name,
date of birth,

23
00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:30.163
physical address,
phone number, email address,

24
00:01:30.163 --> 00:01:35.400
internet protocol, or IP address and
similar information.

25
00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.560
Sensitive personally
identifiable information, known

26
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:48.176
as SPII, is a specific type of PII that
falls under stricter handling guidelines

27
00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:51.841
and may include social security numbers,
medical or

28
00:01:51.841 --> 00:01:56.822
financial information, and
biometric data, such as facial recognition.

29
00:01:56.822 --> 00:02:02.386
If SPII is stolen,
this has the potential to be significantly

30
00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:07.205
more damaging to an individual
than if PII is stolen.

31
00:02:08.205 --> 00:02:12.438
PII and SPII data are key assets
that a threat actor will look for

32
00:02:12.438 --> 00:02:16.012
if an organization experiences a breach.

33
00:02:16.012 --> 00:02:20.508
When a person's identifiable
information is compromised, leaked,

34
00:02:20.508 --> 00:02:24.836
or stolen,
identity theft is the primary concern.

35
00:02:25.836 --> 00:02:29.612
Identity theft is the act of stealing
personal information to commit fraud

36
00:02:29.612 --> 00:02:31.669
while impersonating a victim.

37
00:02:31.669 --> 00:02:35.960
And the primary objective of
identity theft is financial gain.

38
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.938
We've explored several
reasons why security matters.

39
00:02:38.938 --> 00:02:43.562
Employers need security analysts
like you to fill the current and

40
00:02:43.562 --> 00:02:48.356
future demand to protect data,
products, and people while ensuring

41
00:02:48.356 --> 00:02:53.520
confidentiality, integrity, and
safe access to information.

42
00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.154
This is why the U.S. Bureau of
Labor Statistics expects the demand for

43
00:02:58.154 --> 00:03:04.080
security professionals to grow by
more than 30% by the year 2030.

44
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.913
So keep learning, and eventually you'll be
able to do your part to create a safer and

45
00:03:08.913 --> 00:03:12.638
more secure environment for
organizations and people alike!
