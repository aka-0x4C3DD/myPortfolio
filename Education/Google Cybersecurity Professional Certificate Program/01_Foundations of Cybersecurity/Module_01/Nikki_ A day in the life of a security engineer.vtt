2
00:00:04.834 --> 00:00:07.619
My name is Nikki and
I'm a security engineer at Google.

3
00:00:07.619 --> 00:00:12.120
I am part of the insider threat detection
team at Google, so my role is more focused

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.899
on catching insider threats or insider
suspicious activity within the company.

5
00:00:16.899 --> 00:00:20.800
My first experience with cybersecurity
was when I was interning at the aquarium.

6
00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:24.931
I learned a lot of network security there,
they had a lot of phishing attempts,

7
00:00:24.931 --> 00:00:26.482
of course, you know, at the aquarium.

8
00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:30.563
My manager was really focused on making
sure that our networks were secure and

9
00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:34.999
I learned a lot from him and that really
sparked my interest in cybersecurity.

10
00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:39.923
The main reason I chose to pursue a career
in cybersecurity is just how flexible

11
00:00:39.923 --> 00:00:41.202
the career path is.

12
00:00:41.202 --> 00:00:45.121
Once you're in security, there's so
many different fields you can dive into.

13
00:00:45.121 --> 00:00:48.160
Whether it's through the blue team,
protecting the user or

14
00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.796
the red team, which is just, you know, poking
holes in other people's defenses and

15
00:00:51.796 --> 00:00:54.197
letting them know where
they're going wrong.

16
00:00:54.197 --> 00:00:57.303
A day in the life as a entry-
level security professional?

17
00:00:57.303 --> 00:01:01.585
Um, it can change day to day, but
there's two basic parts to it.

18
00:01:01.585 --> 00:01:05.271
There's the operation side,
which is responding to detections and

19
00:01:05.271 --> 00:01:06.623
doing investigations.

20
00:01:06.623 --> 00:01:10.775
And then there's the project side where
you're working with other teams to build

21
00:01:10.775 --> 00:01:13.682
new detections or
improve the current detections.

22
00:01:13.682 --> 00:01:17.409
The difference between this entry-
level cybersecurity analyst and

23
00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:21.104
an entry-level cybersecurity engineer
is pretty much that the analyst

24
00:01:21.104 --> 00:01:23.966
is more focused on operations and
the engineer,

25
00:01:23.966 --> 00:01:28.750
while they can do operations,
they also build the, the detections and

26
00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.475
they do more project focused work.

27
00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:35.749
My favorite task is probably
the operations side doing investigations

28
00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:39.735
because we can sometimes get something
like this actor did such and

29
00:01:39.735 --> 00:01:41.099
such on this day.

30
00:01:41.099 --> 00:01:44.352
And we're supposed to then dive
into what they've been doing,

31
00:01:44.352 --> 00:01:48.509
what they've been working on to figure
out if there's any suspicious activity or

32
00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.440
if it was just a false positive.

33
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.299
One of the biggest ways I've made
an impact as an entry-level cybersecurity

34
00:01:55.299 --> 00:01:59.500
professional is actually working
on the playbooks that, um, our team uses.

35
00:01:59.502 --> 00:02:03.866
A playbook is a list of how to go
through a certain detection, and

36
00:02:03.866 --> 00:02:09.229
what the analyst needs to look at in
order to investigate those incidents.

37
00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:12.906
I was really proud of those, those playbooks
that I've made so far because a lot of my

38
00:02:12.906 --> 00:02:16.259
teammates have even said how
helpful they've been to them.

39
00:02:16.259 --> 00:02:20.907
If you love solving problems,
if you love protecting user data, being at

40
00:02:20.907 --> 00:02:26.110
the front lines of a lot of headlines,
then this is definitely the role for you.
