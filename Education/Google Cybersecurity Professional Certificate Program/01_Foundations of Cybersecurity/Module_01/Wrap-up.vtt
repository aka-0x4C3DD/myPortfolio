00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.790
Congratulations on completing

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:04.875
the first section
of this course!

3
00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:06.690
Let's quickly review what we've

4
00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.835
covered so far, before moving on.

5
00:00:09.835 --> 00:00:11.190
We defined security and introduced

6
00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.340
the benefits of implementing
security in an organization.

7
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.670
Then, we discussed different
job responsibilities,

8
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:19.125
such as managing threats

9
00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:21.030
and installing
prevention software.

10
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:24.165
We also introduced some
important core skills,

11
00:00:24.165 --> 00:00:26.925
like collaboration and
computer forensics.

12
00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:29.625
We finished by discussing
the value of security

13
00:00:29.625 --> 00:00:32.415
and how it supports critical
business functions.

14
00:00:33.415 --> 00:00:35.520
I hope you've gained a greater
understanding of security.

15
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.430
If you feel like you need a
refresher before moving on,

16
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.260
you can always go
back and review

17
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.390
any content you're unsure about.

18
00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:43.940
By learning the basics,

19
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.530
you are laying the
foundation for

20
00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.375
the rest of your
security career.

21
00:00:48.375 --> 00:00:49.340
Coming up, we'll explore

22
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.130
some well-known attacks that
shaped the security industry.

23
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.620
I'm excited to continue
this journey with you!
