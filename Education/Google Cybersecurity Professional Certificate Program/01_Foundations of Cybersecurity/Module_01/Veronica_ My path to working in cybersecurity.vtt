Hi, I'm Veronica and I'm a
security engineer at Google.

2
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.230
My journey into
cybersecurity has

3
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.425
changed my life for the
better in so many ways.

4
00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:15.810
The most important part
is fulfilling work.

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:17.850
I get to do something
that I absolutely

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.760
love and that I'm
super interested in,

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.440
and I feel very lucky

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.660
that this is what I
get to do for work.

9
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.015
Before I entered
my current field,

10
00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:29.490
I had no idea what
cybersecurity was.

11
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.500
My knowledge of cybersecurity

12
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.390
was using secure passwords,

13
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.085
and that was about it.

14
00:00:35.085 --> 00:00:37.230
So if you asked me, you know, would I be in

15
00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.425
cybersecurity five years ago?

16
00:00:39.425 --> 00:00:40.875
I would've said, what is that?

17
00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.760
Someone without a
technical background

18
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.955
can 100% be
successful in cybersecurity.

19
00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:50.390
My path to my current
role in cybersecurity

20
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.850
started as an IT resident

21
00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.120
here at Google
staff in Techstop.

22
00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.130
I learned a lot of
analytical thinking skills,

23
00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.605
working on a help desk,
troubleshooting, debugging.

24
00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:02.765
I didn't realize I had
transferable skills

25
00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:06.200
until I got into my
role in cybersecurity.

26
00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:09.650
And from there, I took
it upon myself

27
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:13.010
to bug a bunch of
security engineers,

28
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.075
interviewed a lot of them.

29
00:01:15.075 --> 00:01:16.560
I didn't get here alone.

30
00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.570
It took a village of
mentors to get me here,

31
00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.635
so don't be afraid
to ask for help.

32
00:01:21.635 --> 00:01:22.970
I don't think someone needs

33
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:25.520
a college degree to go
into cybersecurity.

34
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:27.920
Some of the brightest minds

35
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.725
that I get to work with
don't have a college degree,

36
00:01:30.725 --> 00:01:32.690
so I think that's one
of the best parts

37
00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:33.970
about the industry.

38
00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.510
Looking back at my career,

39
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:40.290
I wish I would

40
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.760
have known that I don't have
to check all the boxes,

41
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.730
that I don't have
to be an expert in

42
00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.600
the area to shoot my shot,

43
00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.655
and I also wish I
would've known that

44
00:01:52.655 --> 00:01:54.680
perfectionism can get in the way

45
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.840
of what you want to achieve.
