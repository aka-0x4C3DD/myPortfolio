1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.530
For any job, you need certain
skills to be successful,

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.390
and many of these
core skills are

3
00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:09.195
transferable from one
role to the next.

4
00:00:09.195 --> 00:00:11.460
No matter what job
you currently have,

5
00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.520
you likely have many
core skills already.

6
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.105
Having a diverse background
enhances your core skills,

7
00:00:18.105 --> 00:00:20.205
which means your
personal experiences

8
00:00:20.205 --> 00:00:22.515
and perspectives are
especially valuable.

9
00:00:23.515 --> 00:00:24.540
In this video, we'll discuss

10
00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:27.030
both transferable and
technical skills that are

11
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.940
particularly useful for
a security analyst.

12
00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.325
Transferable skills
are skills from

13
00:00:32.325 --> 00:00:34.995
other areas that can apply
to different careers.

14
00:00:35.995 --> 00:00:36.750
Technical skills may apply

15
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.430
to several professions as well.

16
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:41.060
However, at times they
may require knowledge of

17
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.380
specific tools,
procedures, and policies.

18
00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.980
Let's discuss some core

19
00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:47.780
transferable skills
you may already have

20
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.400
that will benefit you

21
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.715
in a career as a
security analyst.

22
00:00:51.715 --> 00:00:54.260
Communication is a
transferable skill

23
00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.660
for a security analyst.

24
00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.015
They will often need to describe
certain threats, risks,

25
00:00:59.015 --> 00:01:01.100
or vulnerabilities to people who

26
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.550
may not have a
technical background.

27
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.490
For example, security
analysts may be tasked with

28
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.710
interpreting and
communicating policies

29
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.130
and procedures to
other employees.

30
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.320
Or analysts may be asked
to report findings to

31
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:17.750
their supervisors, so
the appropriate actions

32
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.450
can be taken to secure
the organization.

33
00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.630
Another transferable
skill is collaboration.

34
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.155
Security analysts often work
in teams with engineers,

35
00:01:27.155 --> 00:01:30.635
digital forensic investigators,
and program managers.

36
00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:32.810
For example, if you are working

37
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.000
to roll out a new
security feature,

38
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.360
you will likely have
a project manager,

39
00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.880
an engineer, and an ethical
hacker on your team.

40
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.400
Security analysts also
need to be able to

41
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.915
analyze complex scenarios
that they may encounter.

42
00:01:46.915 --> 00:01:48.405
For example,

43
00:01:48.405 --> 00:01:50.210
a security analyst may need

44
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.115
to make recommendations
about how

45
00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:54.710
different tools can
support efficiency

46
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.885
and safeguard an organization's
internal network.

47
00:01:58.885 --> 00:01:59.960
The last transferable skill that

48
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.955
we'll discuss is
problem-solving.

49
00:02:01.955 --> 00:02:03.920
Identifying a security problem

50
00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:05.720
and then diagnosing
it and providing

51
00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.970
solutions is a necessary skill

52
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.175
to keep business
operations safe.

53
00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:13.220
Understanding threat actors
and identifying trends

54
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.230
can provide insight on how
to handle future threats.

55
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:19.130
Okay, now that we've covered

56
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.170
some important
transferable skills,

57
00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.435
let's discuss some
technical skills

58
00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:25.735
that security analysts
need to develop.

59
00:02:25.735 --> 00:02:27.320
A basic understanding of

60
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.700
programming languages is

61
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.975
an important skill
to develop because

62
00:02:30.975 --> 00:02:33.320
security analysts can
use programming to

63
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:36.530
automate tasks and
identify error messages.

64
00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:38.645
Like learning any
other language,

65
00:02:38.645 --> 00:02:40.415
learning a programming language

66
00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:42.515
may seem challenging at first.

67
00:02:42.515 --> 00:02:45.125
However, this
certificate program

68
00:02:45.125 --> 00:02:47.735
assumes no prior
programming experience,

69
00:02:47.735 --> 00:02:49.820
so we'll start at
the very beginning

70
00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.800
and provide several
opportunities for

71
00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:56.185
hands-on practice with
languages like Python and SQL.

72
00:02:57.185 --> 00:02:59.555
Another important technical
skill is knowing how to use

73
00:02:59.555 --> 00:03:04.190
security information and event
management, or SIEM, tools.

74
00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.760
Security professionals use
SIEM tools to identify and

75
00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.835
analyze security threats,
risks, and vulnerabilities.

76
00:03:11.835 --> 00:03:14.840
For example, a SIEM
tool may alert

77
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.100
you that an unknown user
has accessed the system.

78
00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:21.455
In the event of an unknown
user accessing the system,

79
00:03:21.455 --> 00:03:23.419
you may use computer forensics

80
00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:25.295
to investigate the incident.

81
00:03:26.295 --> 00:03:28.750
Now, let's discuss
computer forensics.

82
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.010
Similar to an investigator and

83
00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:32.450
a forensic scientist working in

84
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.255
the criminal justice system,

85
00:03:34.255 --> 00:03:36.470
digital forensic
investigators will

86
00:03:36.470 --> 00:03:39.035
attempt to identify, analyze,

87
00:03:39.035 --> 00:03:41.870
and preserve criminal
evidence within networks,

88
00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:44.305
computers, and
electronic devices.

89
00:03:45.305 --> 00:03:46.220
Keep in mind that
you may already have

90
00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.650
some of the core skills
we've discussed.

91
00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:51.845
And if you don't have the
technical skills, that's okay!

92
00:03:51.845 --> 00:03:53.360
This program is designed to

93
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:55.645
support you in
learning those skills.

94
00:03:56.645 --> 00:03:57.110
For example, over

95
00:03:57.110 --> 00:03:59.810
the past seven years
working in cybersecurity,

96
00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.030
I've learned that security
analysts need to have

97
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.490
intellectual curiosity
and the motivation

98
00:04:04.490 --> 00:04:06.940
to keep learning in
order to succeed.

99
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.320
Personally, I dedicate time

100
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.570
on a regular basis
towards learning

101
00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:13.760
more Python and SQL
skills in order

102
00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.540
to meet the demands of the
projects I'm working on.

103
00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:18.530
You'll get to learn
about Python and

104
00:04:18.530 --> 00:04:20.590
SQL later in this program.

105
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.595
As you continue this journey,

106
00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.470
you'll build the
knowledge and skills

107
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:27.300
you need to enter
the security field.
