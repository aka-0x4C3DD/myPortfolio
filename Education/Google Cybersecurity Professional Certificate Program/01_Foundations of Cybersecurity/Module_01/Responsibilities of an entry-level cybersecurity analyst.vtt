00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.480
Technology is
rapidly changing and

2
00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.110
so are the tactics and
techniques that attackers use.

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.810
As digital
infrastructure evolves,

4
00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.260
security professionals are
expected to continually grow

5
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.790
their skills in order to

6
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.805
protect and secure
sensitive information.

7
00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:19.980
In this video, we'll discuss

8
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.600
some job responsibilities of

9
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.405
an entry-level security analyst.

10
00:00:25.405 --> 00:00:27.615
So, what do security analysts do?

11
00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:30.080
Security analysts
are responsible for

12
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:33.560
monitoring and protecting
information and systems.

13
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.745
Now, we'll discuss three
primary responsibilities

14
00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:39.350
of a security analyst,

15
00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.790
starting with protecting
computer and network systems.

16
00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.040
Protecting computer and
network systems requires

17
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.715
an analyst to monitor an
organization's internal network.

18
00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:51.770
If a threat is detected, then

19
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.560
an analyst is generally
the first to respond.

20
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.220
Analysts also often take
part in exercises to

21
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.565
search for weaknesses in an
organization's own systems.

22
00:01:02.565 --> 00:01:04.100
For example, a
security analyst may

23
00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.595
contribute to penetration
testing or ethical hacking.

24
00:01:07.595 --> 00:01:10.460
The goal is to penetrate or hack

25
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.115
their own organization's
internal network

26
00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:15.380
to identify vulnerabilities and

27
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.560
suggest ways to strengthen
their security measures.

28
00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.185
Think of it like this.

29
00:01:20.185 --> 00:01:22.025
After you lock your car,

30
00:01:22.025 --> 00:01:24.455
you check the door
handles to make sure

31
00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:27.680
no one can access any
valuables you keep inside.

32
00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.770
Security analysts also
proactively work to

33
00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:33.850
prevent threats from
happening in the first place.

34
00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.560
One way they do this
is by working with

35
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.610
information technology,
or IT, teams to install

36
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.800
prevention software
for the purposes of

37
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.415
identifying risks
and vulnerabilities.

38
00:01:46.415 --> 00:01:47.465
Analysts may also be involved

39
00:01:47.465 --> 00:01:49.730
in software and
hardware development.

40
00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:52.070
They'll often work with
development teams to

41
00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:54.320
support product
security by setting up

42
00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.630
appropriate processes
and systems to

43
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.500
meet the organization's
data protection needs.

44
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.640
The last task we'll discuss is

45
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.680
conducting periodic
security audits.

46
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:05.330
A security audit is

47
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.210
a review of an organization's
security records,

48
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.015
activities, and other
related documents.

49
00:02:11.015 --> 00:02:13.250
For example, an analyst may

50
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:15.335
examine in-house
security issues,

51
00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:17.960
such as making sure that
confidential information,

52
00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:19.850
like individual
computer passwords,

53
00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:22.870
isn't available
to all employees.

54
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.275
Phew, that was a lot to cover!

55
00:02:25.275 --> 00:02:27.590
But hopefully you have
a general idea of what

56
00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:31.180
entry-level security analysts
do on a day-to-day basis.

57
00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:32.720
Security analysts are

58
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.075
an important part of
any organization.

59
00:02:35.075 --> 00:02:37.970
Their daily tasks protect
small businesses,

60
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.260
large companies,

61
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.560
nonprofit organizations,
and government agencies.

62
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.810
They also help to
ensure that the people

63
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.450
served by those
organizations remain safe.
