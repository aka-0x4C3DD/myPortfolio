00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:08.205
Hi, I'm Toni, I'm a Security
Engineering Manager.

2
00:00:08.205 --> 00:00:09.780
Our teams protect Google and

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.150
its users from serious threats.

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.280
Usually government-backed
attackers,

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.440
coordinated influence
operations and

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.645
serious cybercrime
threat actors.

7
00:00:18.645 --> 00:00:20.955
I grew up as an army brat.

8
00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:23.910
My dad was in the military
and we moved around a lot.

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:27.405
I've always had an interest
in security sort of generally.

10
00:00:27.405 --> 00:00:29.100
I got really hooked
on international

11
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:30.540
relations when I
was in high school.

12
00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:32.820
I did a lot of Model
United Nations.

13
00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.550
And that really sort of brought these
two things together for me,

14
00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.400
the way that security
works in the world.

15
00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.430
I come from a big family.

16
00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:40.710
I knew I was going
to need financial

17
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.090
assistance to go to college.

18
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.770
And the Department of
Defense provides

19
00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:46.479
a lot of educational
opportunities

20
00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:47.935
that are tied to service.

21
00:00:47.935 --> 00:00:49.540
So this was a natural fit for me.

22
00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:50.680
I knew I was interested in

23
00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.840
this area and this was going to

24
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.850
provide a career path

25
00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:56.980
into something I was
passionate about.

26
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.825
I started as an
intelligence analyst,

27
00:00:58.825 --> 00:01:00.850
but not focused
on cybersecurity.

28
00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.565
I worked counterinsurgency
for a number of years

29
00:01:03.565 --> 00:01:06.680
and geopolitical
intelligence issues.

30
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.800
Eventually, as I
looked and saw that

31
00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.170
the way that cybersecurity
was starting

32
00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:12.940
to have an impact both in

33
00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:14.230
our daily lives and in

34
00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.880
that world of
international relations,

35
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.065
I got more and more drawn to it.

36
00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:21.895
Transitioning into cybersecurity
was a huge shift for me.

37
00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:24.705
I came in without a solid
technical background,

38
00:01:24.705 --> 00:01:27.290
had to learn a lot of
that on the job and

39
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:28.880
through self-paced learning in

40
00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.305
different types of courses,

41
00:01:30.305 --> 00:01:32.540
I needed to learn
programming languages

42
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.175
like Python and SQL,

43
00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:36.530
two of the things that we
cover in this certificate,

44
00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.124
I needed to learn a
whole new language

45
00:01:39.124 --> 00:01:40.310
about the vocabulary of

46
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.020
threats and the
different components

47
00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.095
and how those
manifest technically.

48
00:01:44.095 --> 00:01:46.640
One of the things that I had
to figure out very early in

49
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.355
this journey is
what kind of learner I was.

50
00:01:49.355 --> 00:01:51.980
I work best with a
structured learning style.

51
00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:53.330
So turning to a lot of

52
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.360
these online courses
and resources that took

53
00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.640
this material and
structured it sort of from

54
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.845
first principles
through application

55
00:02:00.845 --> 00:02:02.585
resonated very well for me.

56
00:02:02.585 --> 00:02:04.160
A lot of this was
also learned on

57
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:05.960
the job by co-workers who

58
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.520
were willing to share and invest

59
00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.215
time in helping me
understand this.

60
00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:12.440
I asked a lot of
questions and I still do.

61
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.140
Most of cybersecurity work
is going to be learned on

62
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:16.550
the job in the specific

63
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:18.260
environment that
you're protecting.

64
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.600
So you have to work well with
your teammates in order to

65
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.255
be able to build
that knowledge base.

66
00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:26.795
My advice would be to stay
curious and keep learning,

67
00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:28.940
especially focusing on
your technical skills

68
00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.965
and growing those
throughout your career.

69
00:02:30.965 --> 00:02:32.270
It's really easy to get

70
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:34.640
imposter syndrome in
cybersecurity because it's so

71
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.410
broad and mastery of

72
00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.570
all these different areas
is a lifetime's work.

73
00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:41.555
And sometimes that
imposter syndrome can

74
00:02:41.555 --> 00:02:43.715
shut us down and
make it feel like,

75
00:02:43.715 --> 00:02:45.210
why bother trying
to keep growing.

76
00:02:45.210 --> 00:02:46.700
I'm never going to
be able to master

77
00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:49.130
this instead of motivating us.

78
00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:51.680
So keep learning, push
through that fear.

79
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.420
The efforts always
going to be rewarded.
