1
00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.110
Imagine that you're
preparing for a storm.

2
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.470
You've received notification
that a storm is coming.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.570
You prepare by gathering

4
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.990
the tools and materials
you'll need to stay safe.

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.230
You make sure your windows
and doors are secure.

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.375
You assemble a first aid kit,

7
00:00:18.375 --> 00:00:22.710
tools, food and water.
You're prepared.

8
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.600
The storm hits and there are

9
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.030
powerful winds and heavy rain.

10
00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:31.365
The storm is using its force
to try and breach your home.

11
00:00:31.365 --> 00:00:33.255
You notice some water leaks

12
00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:34.980
and begin patching them quickly

13
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.745
in order to minimize any
risk or potential damage.

14
00:00:39.745 --> 00:00:41.890
Handling a security
incident is no different.

15
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.280
Organizations must prepare for
the storm by ensuring they

16
00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:48.260
have the tools to mitigate and

17
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.810
quickly respond to
outside threats.

18
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:55.120
The objective is to minimize
risk and potential damage.

19
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.945
As a security analyst,

20
00:00:56.945 --> 00:00:58.340
you'll work to protect

21
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:01.100
your organization and the
people it serves from

22
00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.035
a variety of risks and outside

23
00:01:03.035 --> 00:01:05.810
threats. And if a threat
does get through,

24
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.700
you and your team will provide

25
00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.070
a solution to remedy
the situation.

26
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:13.055
To help you better
understand what this means,

27
00:01:13.055 --> 00:01:15.290
we'll define
security and discuss

28
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.725
the roles of security
professionals in organizations.

29
00:01:19.725 --> 00:01:21.260
Let's start with
some definitions:

30
00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:24.410
Cybersecurity, or
security, is the practice

31
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.635
of ensuring
confidentiality, integrity,

32
00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:29.990
and availability of information

33
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.705
by protecting networks, devices,

34
00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:34.775
people, and data from

35
00:01:34.775 --> 00:01:38.185
unauthorized access or
criminal exploitation.

36
00:01:39.185 --> 00:01:40.540
For example, requiring

37
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:43.550
complex passwords
to access sites and

38
00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.610
services improves
confidentiality by

39
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:48.470
making it much
more difficult for

40
00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.645
a threat actor to
compromise them.

41
00:01:50.645 --> 00:01:53.240
A threat actor is any person

42
00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:56.180
or group who presents
a security risk.

43
00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:58.910
Now that you know the
definition of security,

44
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.915
let's discuss what security
teams do for an organization.

45
00:02:03.915 --> 00:02:06.890
Security protects against
external and internal threats.

46
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.820
An external threat is someone
outside of the organization

47
00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:12.440
trying to gain access to

48
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.680
private information,
networks or devices.

49
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:17.810
An internal threat comes

50
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:19.925
from current or
former employees,

51
00:02:19.925 --> 00:02:23.060
external vendors, or
trusted partners.

52
00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:25.849
Often these internal
threats are accidental,

53
00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.710
such as an employee clicking on

54
00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.660
a compromised link in an email.

55
00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:34.430
Other times, the internal
actor intentionally engages in

56
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:37.265
activities such as
unauthorized data access

57
00:02:37.265 --> 00:02:39.925
or abusing systems
for personal use.

58
00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:42.260
Experienced security
professionals

59
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.610
will help organizations

60
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:47.585
mitigate or reduce the impact
of threats like these.

61
00:02:48.585 --> 00:02:49.895
Security teams also ensure

62
00:02:49.895 --> 00:02:52.940
an organization meets
regulatory compliance, or

63
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:55.190
laws and guidelines, that require

64
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:58.255
the implementation of
specific security standards.

65
00:02:59.255 --> 00:03:00.350
Ensuring that
organizations are in

66
00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.825
compliance may allow
them to avoid fines

67
00:03:02.825 --> 00:03:05.120
and audits, while also upholding

68
00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.095
their ethical obligation
to protect users.

69
00:03:09.095 --> 00:03:10.370
Security teams also maintain

70
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.530
and improve business
productivity.

71
00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:15.635
By establishing a plan
for business continuity,

72
00:03:15.635 --> 00:03:18.680
security teams allow
people to do their jobs,

73
00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.520
even in the case of something
like a data breach.

74
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.930
Being security
conscious can also

75
00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.285
reduce expenses
associated with risks,

76
00:03:26.285 --> 00:03:28.490
such as recovering
from data loss or

77
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.880
operational downtime, and
potentially avoiding fines.

78
00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:33.980
The last benefit of
security that we'll

79
00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:36.665
discuss is maintaining
brand trust.

80
00:03:36.665 --> 00:03:39.800
If services or customer
data are compromised,

81
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.095
this can lower trust
in the organization,

82
00:03:42.095 --> 00:03:45.890
damage the brand, and hurt the
business in the long term.

83
00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.930
Loss of customer trust may

84
00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:50.465
also lead to less revenue
for the business.

85
00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:54.815
Now, let's go over some
common security-based roles.

86
00:03:54.815 --> 00:03:57.065
After completing this
certificate program,

87
00:03:57.065 --> 00:04:00.070
here are some job titles
you may want to search for:

88
00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.600
Security analyst or specialist,

89
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.660
Cybersecurity analyst
or specialist,

90
00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.510
Security operation center or SOC

91
00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:11.800
analyst, Information
security analyst.

92
00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.480
You'll also learn more
about the responsibilities

93
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:15.710
associated with some of

94
00:04:15.710 --> 00:04:18.260
these job titles
later in the program.

95
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:20.014
As you may now realize,

96
00:04:20.014 --> 00:04:21.590
the field of security includes

97
00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:24.470
many topics and concepts and

98
00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:26.210
every activity you complete in

99
00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:29.735
this program moves you one
step closer to a new job.

100
00:04:29.735 --> 00:04:32.310
Let's keep learning together.
