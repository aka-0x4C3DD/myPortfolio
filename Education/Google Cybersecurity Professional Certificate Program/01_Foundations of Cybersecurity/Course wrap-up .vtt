00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.005
Congratulations on
completing the first course!

2
00:00:04.005 --> 00:00:06.300
We've come so far and covered so

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.910
much about a really
exciting industry.

4
00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.315
I find cybersecurity to be
exciting because it's dynamic.

5
00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:14.880
There are always new
puzzles to solve, and

6
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.805
the work of protecting
our users is worthwhile.

7
00:00:18.805 --> 00:00:20.220
Before we move on,
let's take a moment to

8
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.680
celebrate and reflect
on what we've covered.

9
00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.745
First, we introduced
core security concepts,

10
00:00:25.745 --> 00:00:28.685
including what security
is and why it matters.

11
00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:30.080
We also discussed what

12
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.670
an entry-level security analyst

13
00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.405
does and some skills
related to the role.

14
00:00:35.405 --> 00:00:37.670
Then, we transitioned to
eight security domains,

15
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.400
which include security
and risk management,

16
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.660
asset security, and
security operations.

17
00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:47.180
Next, we highlighted security
frameworks and controls.

18
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.940
Specifically, the CIA triad model

19
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.285
and the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework.

20
00:00:53.285 --> 00:00:54.770
Finally, we explored
common tools and

21
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:56.300
programming languages used by

22
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.610
security analysts, such as SIEMs,

23
00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.230
playbooks, SQL, and Python.

24
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:04.850
I hope you're proud of the
work you've done so far.

25
00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.520
No matter what direction

26
00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:08.515
you take in the
security industry,

27
00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:10.120
everything you've learned lays

28
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:13.095
the foundation for the
next phase of your career.

29
00:01:13.095 --> 00:01:15.530
And, as you move through
this program,

30
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.970
you'll have the chance to
develop your skills further.

31
00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:22.330
In the next course, we'll
provide more details about

32
00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:25.300
several of the topics
introduced in this course.

33
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.180
Hi, I'm Ashley, and I
will be guiding you

34
00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.090
through the next course of
this certificate program.

35
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:33.340
We'll discuss
security domains and

36
00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:36.185
business operations
in greater detail.

37
00:01:37.185 --> 00:01:38.170
I'm so glad I was able to

38
00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.045
be here for the beginning
of your journey.

39
00:01:40.045 --> 00:01:41.860
You're off to a great start.

40
00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:43.330
I'm excited for you to reach

41
00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:46.370
your goal of joining
the security industry!
