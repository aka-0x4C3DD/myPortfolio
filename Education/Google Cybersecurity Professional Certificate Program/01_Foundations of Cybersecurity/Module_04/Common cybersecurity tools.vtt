00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.550
As mentioned earlier,

2
00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:04.755
security is like
preparing for a storm.

3
00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:06.270
If you identify a leak,

4
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.010
the color or shape
of the bucket you

5
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.170
use to catch the
water doesn't matter.

6
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:13.230
What is important is
mitigating the risks and

7
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.665
threats to your home, by using
the tools available to you.

8
00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:19.290
As an entry-level
security analyst,

9
00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.970
you'll have a lot of tools in

10
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:22.440
your toolkit that you can

11
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.735
use to mitigate potential risks.

12
00:00:25.735 --> 00:00:26.970
In this video, we'll discuss

13
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:29.055
the primary purposes
and functions

14
00:00:29.055 --> 00:00:31.650
of some commonly
used security tools.

15
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.075
And later in the program,

16
00:00:33.075 --> 00:00:35.100
you'll have hands-on
opportunities

17
00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.600
to practice using them.

18
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.835
Before discussing tools further,

19
00:00:38.835 --> 00:00:40.870
let's briefly discuss logs,

20
00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:42.470
which are the
source of data that

21
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:45.185
the tools we'll cover are
designed to organize.

22
00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:47.930
A log is a record of events that

23
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:51.175
occur within an
organization's systems.

24
00:00:51.175 --> 00:00:55.430
Examples of security-related
logs include records of

25
00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:57.560
employees signing
into their computers

26
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.855
or accessing web-based services.

27
00:00:59.855 --> 00:01:02.600
Logs help security
professionals identify

28
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.065
vulnerabilities and
potential security breaches.

29
00:01:07.065 --> 00:01:08.720
The first tools we'll discuss are

30
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.795
security information and
event management tools,

31
00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:13.505
or SIEM tools.

32
00:01:13.505 --> 00:01:17.060
A SIEM tool is an application
that collects and

33
00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:19.070
analyzes log data to monitor

34
00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:21.625
critical activities
in an organization.

35
00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:27.630
The acronym S-I-E-M may be
pronounced as 'sim' or 'seem',

36
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.525
but we'll use 'sim'
throughout this program.

37
00:01:30.525 --> 00:01:35.060
SIEM tools collect real-time,
or instant, information,

38
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:36.950
and allow security analysts to

39
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.830
identify potential
breaches as they happen.

40
00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:43.040
Imagine having to read
pages and pages of

41
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.385
logs to determine if there
are any security threats.

42
00:01:46.385 --> 00:01:48.275
Depending on the amount of data,

43
00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:50.950
it could take hours or days.

44
00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.590
SIEM tools reduce the amount
of data an analyst must

45
00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.690
review by providing alerts for

46
00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:59.705
specific types of
risks and threats.

47
00:01:59.705 --> 00:02:04.310
Next, let's go over examples
of commonly used SIEM tools:

48
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.650
Splunk and Chronicle.

49
00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:09.695
Splunk is a data
analysis platform,

50
00:02:09.695 --> 00:02:13.135
and Splunk Enterprise
provides SIEM solutions.

51
00:02:13.135 --> 00:02:17.375
Splunk Enterprise is a
self-hosted tool used to retain,

52
00:02:17.375 --> 00:02:21.215
analyze, and search an
organization's log data.

53
00:02:22.215 --> 00:02:24.805
Another SIEM tool is
Google's Chronicle.

54
00:02:24.805 --> 00:02:27.920
Chronicle is a cloud-native SIEM tool that

55
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.165
stores security data for
search and analysis.

56
00:02:31.165 --> 00:02:33.590
Cloud-native means
that Chronicle

57
00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:36.355
allows for fast delivery
of new features.

58
00:02:37.355 --> 00:02:39.425
Both of these SIEM tools,
and SIEMs in general,

59
00:02:39.425 --> 00:02:41.525
collect data from
multiple places,

60
00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:44.360
then analyze and filter
that data to allow

61
00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:46.610
security teams to
prevent and quickly

62
00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.450
react to potential
security threats.

63
00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.455
As a security analyst,

64
00:02:51.455 --> 00:02:53.750
you may find yourself
using SIEM tools to

65
00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.420
analyze filtered
events and patterns,

66
00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.850
perform incident analysis,

67
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:01.655
or proactively
search for threats.

68
00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:05.760
Depending on your organization's
SIEM setup and risk focus,

69
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.030
the tools and how they
function may differ,

70
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:11.965
but ultimately, they are
all used to mitigate risk.

71
00:03:12.965 --> 00:03:14.330
Other key tools that
you will use in

72
00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:16.190
your role as a security analyst,

73
00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:17.780
and that you'll have hands-on

74
00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.370
opportunities to use later in

75
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:23.525
the program, are playbooks and
network protocol analyzers.

76
00:03:24.525 --> 00:03:25.880
A playbook is a manual that

77
00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:28.625
provides details about
any operational action,

78
00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:30.905
such as how to respond
to an incident.

79
00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:34.550
Playbooks, which vary from one
organization to the next,

80
00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:36.110
guide analysts in how to

81
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:38.240
handle a security
incident before,

82
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:41.105
during, and after
it has occurred.

83
00:03:41.105 --> 00:03:43.700
Playbooks can pertain
to security or

84
00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.040
compliance reviews,
access management,

85
00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:48.380
and many other
organizational tasks that

86
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.755
require a documented process
from beginning to end.

87
00:03:52.755 --> 00:03:53.510
Another tool you may use as

88
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:57.035
a security analyst is a
network protocol analyzer,

89
00:03:57.035 --> 00:03:59.380
also called packet sniffer.

90
00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.390
A packet sniffer is
a tool designed to

91
00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:05.600
capture and analyze data
traffic within a network.

92
00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.000
Common network
protocol analyzers

93
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.560
include tcpdump and Wireshark.

94
00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:13.355
As an entry-level analyst,

95
00:04:13.355 --> 00:04:15.680
you don't have to be an
expert in these tools.

96
00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:16.910
As you continue through

97
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:19.985
this certificate program and
get more hands-on practice,

98
00:04:19.985 --> 00:04:22.340
you'll continuously build
your understanding of

99
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.635
how to use these
tools to identify,

100
00:04:24.635 --> 00:04:27.540
assess, and mitigate risks.
