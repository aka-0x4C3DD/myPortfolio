00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.925
As we discussed previously,

2
00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:06.105
organizations use a variety
of tools, such as SIEMs,

3
00:00:06.105 --> 00:00:09.285
playbooks, and packet
sniffers to better manage,

4
00:00:09.285 --> 00:00:11.760
monitor, and analyze
security threats.

5
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:15.420
But those aren't the only
tools in an analyst's toolkit.

6
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.090
Analysts also use
programming languages and

7
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:20.880
operating systems to
accomplish essential tasks.

8
00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:23.780
In this video, we'll
introduce you to Python and

9
00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.145
SQL programming, and the
Linux operating system.

10
00:00:27.145 --> 00:00:29.540
All of which you'll have
an opportunity to practice

11
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:31.835
using later in the
certificate program.

12
00:00:32.835 --> 00:00:34.160
Organizations can use
programming to create

13
00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.915
a specific set of instructions

14
00:00:35.915 --> 00:00:38.155
for a computer to execute tasks.

15
00:00:38.155 --> 00:00:40.400
Programming allows analysts to

16
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.080
complete repetitive tasks and

17
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.130
processes with a high degree
of accuracy and efficiency.

18
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.370
It also helps reduce the
risk of human error, and can

19
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.690
save hours or days

20
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.015
compared to performing
the work manually.

21
00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:54.680
Now that you're aware of what

22
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.450
programming languages
are used for,

23
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:57.530
let's discuss

24
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.930
a specific and related
operating system called

25
00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:04.650
Linux, and two programming
languages: SQL and Python.

26
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.330
Linux is an open-source, or

27
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.880
publicly available,
operating system.

28
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.075
Unlike other operating systems
you may be familiar with,

29
00:01:13.075 --> 00:01:15.995
for example MacOS or Windows,

30
00:01:15.995 --> 00:01:18.025
Linux relies on a command line

31
00:01:18.025 --> 00:01:20.215
as the primary user interface.

32
00:01:20.215 --> 00:01:22.960
Linux itself is not a
programming language,

33
00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.550
but it does allow for the use of

34
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.770
text-based commands
between the user

35
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.370
and the operating system.

36
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.510
You'll learn more about
Linux later in the program.

37
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:33.400
A common use of Linux for

38
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.500
entry-level security analysts is

39
00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:37.120
examining logs to better

40
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:39.740
understand what's
occurring in a system.

41
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.590
For example, you might

42
00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:43.420
find yourself using
commands to review

43
00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.265
an error log when investigating

44
00:01:45.265 --> 00:01:48.010
uncommonly high network traffic.

45
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.220
Next, let's discuss SQL.

46
00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:54.755
SQL stands for Structured
Query Language.

47
00:01:54.755 --> 00:01:57.790
SQL is a programming
language used to create,

48
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:01.690
interact with, and request
information from a database.

49
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:04.180
A database is an
organized collection

50
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:05.965
of information or data.

51
00:02:05.965 --> 00:02:09.365
There may be millions of
data points in a database.

52
00:02:09.365 --> 00:02:12.430
So an entry-level security
analyst would use SQL to

53
00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:13.855
filter through the data points

54
00:02:13.855 --> 00:02:16.135
to retrieve specific
information.

55
00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:19.795
The last programming language
we'll introduce is Python.

56
00:02:19.795 --> 00:02:21.790
Security professionals can use

57
00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:23.590
Python to perform tasks that are

58
00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.960
repetitive and
time-consuming and that

59
00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:29.075
require a high level of
detail and accuracy.

60
00:02:30.075 --> 00:02:30.700
As a future analyst,

61
00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.240
it's important to
understand that

62
00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.160
every organization's
toolkit may be

63
00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.205
somewhat different based
on their security needs.

64
00:02:37.205 --> 00:02:39.410
The main point is that
you're familiar with

65
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.110
some industry standard tools
because that will show

66
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.600
employers that you have the
ability to learn how to use

67
00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:46.220
their tools to protect

68
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.655
the organization and
the people it serves.

69
00:02:49.655 --> 00:02:49.810
You're doing great!

70
00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.670
Later in the course, you'll learn
more about Linux and

71
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.190
programming languages,
and you'll practice

72
00:02:55.190 --> 00:02:59.070
using these tools in
security-related scenarios.
