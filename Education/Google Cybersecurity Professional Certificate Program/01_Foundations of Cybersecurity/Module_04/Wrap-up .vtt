00:00:01.086 --> 00:00:05.451
That completes the introduction to
security tools and programming languages!

2
00:00:06.451 --> 00:00:10.275
In this section of the course, we covered
SIEM tools such as Splunk and Chronicle.

3
00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:13.974
We also discussed how SIEM tools are used
by security analysts to complete

4
00:00:13.974 --> 00:00:16.201
different tasks.

5
00:00:17.201 --> 00:00:19.558
Then, we discussed other
tools such as playbooks and

6
00:00:19.558 --> 00:00:23.450
network protocol analyzers,
also called packet sniffers.

7
00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:27.295
Finally, we introduced the Linux operating
system and the programming languages

8
00:00:27.295 --> 00:00:29.400
SQL and Python.

9
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:32.900
Remember, the tools we discussed take
time to understand completely.

10
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.287
But having a basic understanding
of these tools can help you

11
00:00:36.287 --> 00:00:39.381
get a job in the security field and
progress in your career!
