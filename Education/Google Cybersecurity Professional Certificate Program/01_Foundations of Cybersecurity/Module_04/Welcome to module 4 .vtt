00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.975
Welcome to the final
section of this course!

2
00:00:03.975 --> 00:00:06.510
Here, we'll be
introducing tools and

3
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.830
programming languages that are

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.230
commonly used in
the security field.

5
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:13.260
They are essential for
monitoring security in

6
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:14.850
an organization
because they enhance

7
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.260
efficiency by automating tasks.

8
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.070
Although we're only introducing

9
00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:21.095
these concepts and
tools at this point,

10
00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:22.505
later in the program,

11
00:00:22.505 --> 00:00:24.380
you'll have opportunities
to use them in

12
00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.785
a variety of
hands-on activities.

13
00:00:27.785 --> 00:00:28.565
In the following videos,

14
00:00:28.565 --> 00:00:31.160
you'll learn about
security information and

15
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:34.255
event management, or SIEM, tools.

16
00:00:34.255 --> 00:00:36.590
You'll also be introduced
to other tools such as

17
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:39.605
playbooks and network
protocol analyzers.

18
00:00:40.605 --> 00:00:42.710
Then, you'll learn about the
Linux operating system and

19
00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.170
security-related tasks
that are initiated through

20
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:48.620
programming languages,
such as SQL and Python.

21
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.100
For me, SQL is one of
the most useful tools.

22
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:53.705
It allows me to explore

23
00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:55.760
all the different data
sources we collect,

24
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.210
and it allows my team to
analyze the data for trends.

25
00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:01.640
Take your time going
through the videos

26
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.905
and if you need
to, re-watch them.

27
00:01:03.905 --> 00:01:05.900
Also know that
these tools will be

28
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.910
discussed in much more detail,

29
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:09.470
and you will be able
to practice them

30
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.455
firsthand, later in the
certificate program.

31
00:01:13.455 --> 00:01:15.620
While every organization has
their own set of tools and

32
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.755
training materials that you'll
learn to use on the job,

33
00:01:18.755 --> 00:01:20.420
this program will provide you

34
00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.130
with foundational
knowledge that will

35
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.490
help you succeed in
the security industry.

36
00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.650
Let's get started!
