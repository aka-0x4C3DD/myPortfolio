Hi, I'm Holly and I'm

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.025
a Cloud Security Architect
with Google Cloud.

3
00:00:08.025 --> 00:00:10.440
At the beginning of
my adult career,

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:13.005
I sold hosiery while I
was going to school.

5
00:00:13.005 --> 00:00:16.815
That led me into an opportunity
to work in banking,

6
00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:18.150
which then led me into

7
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.940
an opportunity to work
in telecommunications.

8
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.910
From there I managed
to get myself into

9
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.940
a security vendor
and learn security.

10
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.090
Part of the way
that I was able to

11
00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:31.940
change from my original half
of my tech career being

12
00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:34.355
a database administrator
to getting into

13
00:00:34.355 --> 00:00:37.730
cybersecurity was through
getting certificates

14
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.980
like you're doing today.

15
00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.780
Those really helped me
gain credibility with

16
00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.940
potential employers
when I didn't

17
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:46.690
have the experience in
this particular field yet.

18
00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:50.235
Ethics are really the
crux of cybersecurity,

19
00:00:50.235 --> 00:00:52.970
you need to be able to
be ethical in all of

20
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.215
your actions in order to be a
cybersecurity professional.

21
00:00:56.215 --> 00:00:58.880
Examples of unethical
behavior are

22
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.315
usually honestly just
slight laziness,

23
00:01:02.315 --> 00:01:04.670
people taking shortcuts
and not really

24
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.625
thinking about the
consequences of their actions.

25
00:01:07.625 --> 00:01:10.760
So, certainly when people
share passwords to

26
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.615
systems or give out
private information,

27
00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:16.220
or look into systems for

28
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.880
their own personal information

29
00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.055
or purposes about people they
know or about celebrities.

30
00:01:25.055 --> 00:01:28.310
One of the most difficult
situations that I ever faced in

31
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.710
my technology career related

32
00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.040
to ethics was shortly after 9/11,

33
00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:37.715
my boss's boss's boss came to me

34
00:01:37.715 --> 00:01:41.975
with a bunch of keywords
that were clearly

35
00:01:41.975 --> 00:01:44.180
related to the attack in

36
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.020
New York and asked me to
query the database that I

37
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:51.320
administered that had everybody's
text messages in it for

38
00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.780
the entire
telecommunications company

39
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.435
without anything in writing
and without a court order.

40
00:01:56.435 --> 00:01:59.825
I was in a very uncomfortable
position to tell

41
00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:01.610
someone that much senior than me

42
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.660
that I wasn't
comfortable doing that.

43
00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:07.040
I suggested that he bring
something in writing to

44
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:08.870
me to do that and he

45
00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:10.850
found someone else
who did it for him.

46
00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:13.610
When you're faced with one of
these difficult decisions,

47
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:16.010
it's good to think
about what would be

48
00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.500
the consequences
of your decision.

49
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.600
My encouragement to those
of you out here taking

50
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.480
this program is that
the rewards that you

51
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:26.330
get from helping to protect
your company or your users or

52
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.505
your organization from cyber
criminals is really great.

53
00:02:30.505 --> 00:02:32.660
We get to be the
good guys and help

54
00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:34.955
protect our industry and

55
00:02:34.955 --> 00:02:37.490
our customers from cyber attacks

56
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.590
and cyber criminals.
That's rewarding.
