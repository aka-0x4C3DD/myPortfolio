00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.350
You are now better prepared
to understand and help

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.335
make decisions regarding
assessing and managing risks.

3
00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:08.830
Let's review what we've covered.

4
00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:11.070
We discussed security
frameworks and

5
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.170
controls and how
they're used to develop

6
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.150
processes and procedures that

7
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:17.745
protect organizations and
the people they serve.

8
00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:20.850
We also discussed core
components of frameworks,

9
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.160
such as identifying
security goals and

10
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.220
establishing guidelines
to achieve those goals.

11
00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:29.855
Then, we introduced specific
frameworks and controls,

12
00:00:29.855 --> 00:00:33.965
including the CIA triad
and the NIST CSF,

13
00:00:33.965 --> 00:00:36.310
and how they are
used to manage risk.

14
00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:39.185
And finally, we discussed
security ethics,

15
00:00:39.185 --> 00:00:41.150
including common
ethical issues to

16
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.445
consider, such as
confidentiality,

17
00:00:43.445 --> 00:00:46.120
privacy protections, and laws.

18
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.470
You're almost there, only one

19
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.495
more section to go
in this course.

20
00:00:50.495 --> 00:00:53.480
Coming up, you'll learn
about common tools and

21
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.160
programming languages used by

22
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.720
security analysts to protect
organizational operations.

23
00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.190
Hope you're as excited
as I am to keep going!
