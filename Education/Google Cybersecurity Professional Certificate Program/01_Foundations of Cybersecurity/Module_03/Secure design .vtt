00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.760
Hi, welcome back!

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.980
Previously, we
discussed frameworks

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.375
and controls in general.

4
00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:08.010
In this video,
you'll learn about

5
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:11.040
specific frameworks and
controls that organizations

6
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.290
can voluntarily use to minimize

7
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.125
risks to their data
and to protect users.

8
00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:18.085
Let's get started!

9
00:00:19.085 --> 00:00:21.780
The CIA triad is a foundational model

10
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.390
that helps inform how
organizations consider

11
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.840
risk when setting up systems
and security policies.

12
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.050
CIA stands for confidentiality,

13
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:33.645
integrity, and availability.

14
00:00:34.645 --> 00:00:37.320
Confidentiality means that
only authorized users

15
00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:40.260
can access specific
assets or data.

16
00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.760
For example, strict
access controls that

17
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.630
define who should and should
not have access to data,

18
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:49.370
must be put in place to ensure

19
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.940
confidential data remains safe.

20
00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:54.290
Integrity means the data is

21
00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.100
correct, authentic,
and reliable.

22
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.880
To maintain integrity,

23
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.310
security professionals
can use a form of

24
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.125
data protection like encryption

25
00:01:03.125 --> 00:01:05.585
to safeguard data from
being tampered with.

26
00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:08.120
Availability means data is

27
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.015
accessible to those who are
authorized to access it.

28
00:01:11.984 --> 00:01:13.010
Let's define a term
that came up during

29
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.110
our discussion of the CIA triad:

30
00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:16.500
asset.

31
00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:20.840
An asset is an item perceived as having
value to an organization.

32
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.870
And value is determined by the cost

33
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:24.225
associated with the
asset in question.

34
00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:28.960
For example, an application
that stores sensitive data,

35
00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.080
such as social security
numbers or bank accounts,

36
00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.615
is a valuable asset
to an organization.

37
00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:37.344
It carries more risk
and therefore requires

38
00:01:37.344 --> 00:01:39.865
tighter security
controls in comparison

39
00:01:39.865 --> 00:01:42.100
to a website that shares
publicly available news content.

40
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.620
As you may remember,

41
00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:45.700
earlier in the course,

42
00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.520
we discussed frameworks
and controls in general.

43
00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:51.730
Now, we'll discuss a specific
framework developed by

44
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.200
the U.S.-based National

45
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.595
Institute of Standards
and Technology:

46
00:01:55.595 --> 00:01:57.890
the Cybersecurity
Framework, also

47
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.625
referred to as the NIST CSF.

48
00:02:00.625 --> 00:02:03.110
The NIST Cybersecurity
Framework is

49
00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:05.005
a voluntary framework that
consists of standards,

50
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:08.120
guidelines, and best practices

51
00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.175
to manage cybersecurity risk.

52
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.890
It's important to become
familiar with this framework

53
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.720
because security teams use it as

54
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.145
a baseline to manage
short and long-term risk.

55
00:02:18.145 --> 00:02:20.720
Managing and mitigating
risks and protecting

56
00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.280
an organization's assets from

57
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:25.570
threat actors are key goals
for security professionals.

58
00:02:25.570 --> 00:02:27.395
Understanding the
different motives

59
00:02:27.395 --> 00:02:28.000
a threat actor may have,

60
00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.310
alongside identifying
your organization's

61
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.790
most valuable assets
is important.

62
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.170
Some of the most
dangerous threat actors

63
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.495
to consider are
disgruntled employees.

64
00:02:38.495 --> 00:02:40.500
They are the most dangerous
because they often have

65
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:43.054
access to sensitive information

66
00:02:43.054 --> 00:02:44.860
and know where to find it.

67
00:02:44.860 --> 00:02:47.480
In order to reduce
this type of risk,

68
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.310
security professionals would use

69
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.960
the principle of availability,

70
00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.150
as well as organizational
guidelines

71
00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:55.100
based on frameworks to ensure

72
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.100
staff members can only access

73
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.435
the data they need to
perform their jobs.

74
00:02:59.435 --> 00:03:02.200
Threat actors originate
from all across the globe,

75
00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.420
and a diverse workforce
of security professionals

76
00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.975
helps organizations identify
attackers' intentions.

77
00:03:08.975 --> 00:03:12.515
A variety of perspectives
can assist organizations in

78
00:03:12.515 --> 00:03:14.090
understanding and mitigating

79
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:16.020
the impact of
malicious activity.

80
00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
That concludes our
introduction to

81
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
the CIA triad and
NIST CSF framework,

82
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.080
which are used to
develop processes to

83
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.300
secure organizations and
the people they serve.

84
00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:29.450
You may be asked in
an interview if you

85
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.970
know about security
frameworks and principles.

86
00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:34.220
Or you may be asked to
explain how they're

87
00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:37.000
used to secure
organizational assets.

88
00:03:37.315 --> 00:03:40.500
In either case,
throughout this program,

89
00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:41.660
you'll have multiple
opportunities

90
00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:43.000
to learn more about them

91
00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
and apply what we've discussed
to real-world situations.

92
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.320
Coming up, we'll discuss

93
00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.270
the ethics of security.
See you soon!
