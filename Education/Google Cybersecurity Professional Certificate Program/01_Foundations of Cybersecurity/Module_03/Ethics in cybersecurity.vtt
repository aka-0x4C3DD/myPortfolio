00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:04.593
In security, new technologies
present new challenges.

2
00:00:04.593 --> 00:00:07.995
For every new security incident or
risk, the right or

3
00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:10.740
wrong decision isn't always clear.

4
00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:15.915
For example, imagine that you're working
as an entry-level security analyst and

5
00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:18.930
you have received a high risk alert.

6
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.413
You investigate the alert and

7
00:00:20.413 --> 00:00:23.621
discover data has been
transferred without authorization.

8
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.154
You work diligently to identify
who made the transfer and

9
00:00:28.154 --> 00:00:30.928
discover it is one of
your friends from work.

10
00:00:30.928 --> 00:00:33.398
What do you do?

11
00:00:34.398 --> 00:00:38.307
Ethically, as a security professional,
your job is to remain unbiased and

12
00:00:38.307 --> 00:00:41.165
maintain security and confidentiality.

13
00:00:42.165 --> 00:00:44.035
While it's normal to
want to protect a friend,

14
00:00:44.035 --> 00:00:49.061
regardless of who the user in question may
be, your responsibility and obligation

15
00:00:49.061 --> 00:00:53.790
is to adhere to the policies and
protocols you've been trained to follow.

16
00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.210
In many cases, security teams are
entrusted with greater access to data and

17
00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.780
information than other employees.

18
00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:06.179
Security professionals must respect that
privilege and act ethically at all times.

19
00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:08.043
Security ethics are guidelines for

20
00:01:08.043 --> 00:01:11.840
making appropriate decisions
as a security professional.

21
00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.808
As another example, if you as an analyst
have the ability to grant yourself access

22
00:01:16.808 --> 00:01:21.488
to payroll data and can give yourself
a raise, just because you have access to do

23
00:01:21.488 --> 00:01:24.130
so, does that mean you should?

24
00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:26.060
The answer is no.

25
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.276
You should never abuse the access
you've been granted and entrusted with.

26
00:01:31.276 --> 00:01:33.784
Let's discuss ethical principles that
may raise questions as you navigate

27
00:01:33.784 --> 00:01:36.837
solutions for mitigating risks.

28
00:01:36.837 --> 00:01:41.652
These are confidentiality,
privacy protections, and laws.

29
00:01:42.652 --> 00:01:45.980
Let's begin with the first ethical
principle, confidentiality.

30
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.410
Earlier we discussed confidentiality
as part of the CIA triad.

31
00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:55.940
Now let's discuss how confidentiality
can be applied to ethics.

32
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:59.240
As a security professional,
you'll encounter proprietary

33
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.740
or private information, such as PII.

34
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:07.670
It's your ethical duty to keep that
information confidential and safe.

35
00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:12.232
For example, you may want to help
out a coworker by providing computer

36
00:02:12.232 --> 00:02:16.035
system access outside of
properly documented channels.

37
00:02:16.035 --> 00:02:20.347
However, this ethical violation can
result in serious consequences,

38
00:02:20.347 --> 00:02:24.804
including reprimands, the loss of
your professional reputation, and

39
00:02:24.804 --> 00:02:28.490
legal repercussions for
both you and your friend.

40
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.162
The second ethical principle to
consider is privacy protections.

41
00:02:32.162 --> 00:02:35.986
Privacy protection means safeguarding
personal information from

42
00:02:35.986 --> 00:02:37.570
unauthorized use.

43
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:40.984
For example,
imagine you receive a personal email after

44
00:02:40.984 --> 00:02:45.480
hours from your manager requesting
a colleague's home phone number.

45
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.369
Your manager explains that they can't
access the employee database at the moment,

46
00:02:49.369 --> 00:02:53.204
but they need to discuss
an urgent matter with that person.

47
00:02:54.204 --> 00:02:58.173
As a security analyst, your role is to
follow the policies and procedures of your company,

48
00:02:58.173 --> 00:03:01.632
which in this example, state
that employee information is stored

49
00:03:01.632 --> 00:03:07.548
in a secure database and should never be
accessed or shared in any other format.

50
00:03:07.548 --> 00:03:13.890
So, accessing and sharing the employee's
personal information would be unethical.

51
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:17.740
In situations like this,
it can be difficult to know what to do.

52
00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:20.839
So, the best response is to
adhere to the policies and procedures

53
00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:23.226
set by your organization.

54
00:03:24.226 --> 00:03:27.083
A third important ethical principle
we must discuss is the law.

55
00:03:27.083 --> 00:03:30.189
Laws are rules that
are recognized by a community and

56
00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:32.800
enforced by a governing entity.

57
00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.149
For example, consider a staff
member at a hospital who has been trained

58
00:03:37.149 --> 00:03:42.070
to handle PII,
and SPII for compliance.

59
00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:45.696
The staff member has files with
confidential data that should never be left

60
00:03:45.696 --> 00:03:49.800
unsupervised, but
the staff member is late for a meeting.

61
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.184
Instead of locking the files
in a designated area,

62
00:03:53.184 --> 00:03:57.133
the files are left on the staff
member's desk, unsupervised.

63
00:03:57.133 --> 00:04:00.800
Upon the employee's return,
the files are missing.

64
00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.980
The staff member has just violated
multiple compliance regulations, and

65
00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:09.891
their actions were unethical and illegal,
since their negligence has likely resulted

66
00:04:09.891 --> 00:04:12.691
in the loss of private patient and
hospital data.

67
00:04:13.691 --> 00:04:18.072
As you enter the security field, remember
that technology is constantly evolving,

68
00:04:18.072 --> 00:04:21.002
and so are attackers' tactics and
techniques.

69
00:04:21.002 --> 00:04:25.787
Because of this, security professionals
must continue to think critically about

70
00:04:25.787 --> 00:04:27.570
how to respond to attacks.

71
00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:32.241
Having a strong sense of ethics can guide
your decisions to ensure that the proper

72
00:04:32.241 --> 00:04:33.066
processes and procedures

73
00:04:33.066 --> 00:04:37.412
are followed to mitigate
these continually evolving risks.
