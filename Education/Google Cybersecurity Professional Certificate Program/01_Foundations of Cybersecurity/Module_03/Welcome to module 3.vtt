00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.572
Hi there, glad to have you back!

2
00:00:03.572 --> 00:00:07.744
You're halfway done with the first course,
so you're making great progress.

3
00:00:08.744 --> 00:00:08.880
In this section,

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.110
we'll discuss how organizations protect
themselves from threats, risks, and

5
00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:20.220
vulnerabilities by covering key principles
such as: frameworks, controls, and ethics.

6
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:24.603
To help you better understand how this
relates to the role of a security analyst,

7
00:00:24.603 --> 00:00:25.960
we'll use an analogy.

8
00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.837
Imagine you want to plant a garden.
You research, plan, prepare,

9
00:00:29.837 --> 00:00:33.786
and purchase materials while
considering all the things that could

10
00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:36.650
potentially present a risk to your garden.

11
00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:39.837
You establish a plan to pull weeds,
spray for bugs,

12
00:00:39.837 --> 00:00:44.410
and water your plants regularly
to prevent issues or incidents.

13
00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:48.110
But as the days go by,
unexpected problems arise.

14
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.025
The weather has been unpredictable and

15
00:00:50.025 --> 00:00:54.050
pests have been aggressively
trying to infiltrate your garden.

16
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.635
You start implementing better ways to
safeguard your garden by installing

17
00:00:58.635 --> 00:01:01.544
a surveillance camera,
building a fence, and

18
00:01:01.544 --> 00:01:06.217
covering your plants with a canopy to
keep your garden healthy and growing.

19
00:01:06.217 --> 00:01:09.588
Now that you have a better idea
about the threats to your garden and

20
00:01:09.588 --> 00:01:11.390
how to keep your plants safe,

21
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:15.937
you establish better policies and
procedures to continuously monitor and

22
00:01:15.937 --> 00:01:17.620
safeguard your garden.

23
00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.770
In this way, security resembles a garden.

24
00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:24.428
It's an evolving industry that will
challenge you to make continuous

25
00:01:24.428 --> 00:01:28.708
improvements to policies and procedures
that help protect your organization and

26
00:01:28.708 --> 00:01:29.401
the people it serves.

27
00:01:30.401 --> 00:01:33.603
To that end, we'll
introduce security frameworks and

28
00:01:33.603 --> 00:01:36.780
controls and
explain why they're important.

29
00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:42.221
We'll also cover core components and
specific examples of frameworks and

30
00:01:42.221 --> 00:01:46.948
controls, including the Confidentiality,
Integrity, and

31
00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:49.547
Availability Triad, or CIA Triad.

32
00:01:49.547 --> 00:01:52.822
We'll end with the discussion
about the ethics of security and

33
00:01:52.822 --> 00:01:56.260
share a few notable ethical
concerns in the security field.

34
00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.969
Evolving security practices may
seem a little abstract, but

35
00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.030
many of us use them every day.

36
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.896
For example, I use security keys,
which are a type of security control,

37
00:02:06.896 --> 00:02:10.756
as a second form of authentication
to access my accounts.

38
00:02:10.756 --> 00:02:14.045
The keys ensure that only
I can access my accounts,

39
00:02:14.045 --> 00:02:16.734
even if a password has been compromised.

40
00:02:16.734 --> 00:02:18.709
By improving confidentiality,

41
00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:23.040
they also assure me that the integrity
of my accounts is intact.

42
00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:27.324
Having processes and procedures in
place to organize security efforts and

43
00:02:27.324 --> 00:02:31.020
make informed decisions is important for
any organization.

44
00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:33.921
I'm so excited to get started,
and I hope you are too!
