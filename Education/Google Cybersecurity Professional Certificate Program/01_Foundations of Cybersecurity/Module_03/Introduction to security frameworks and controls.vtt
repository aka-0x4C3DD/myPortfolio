1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.050
Imagine you're working as a
security analyst and receive

2
00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:07.815
multiple alerts about suspicious
activity on the network.

3
00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:10.110
You realize that you'll need to implement

4
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.060
additional security
measures to keep

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.170
these alerts from becoming

6
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.500
serious incidents. But
where do you start?

7
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.380
As an analyst, you'll
start by identifying

8
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.755
your organization's
critical assets and risks.

9
00:00:22.755 --> 00:00:24.060
Then you'll implement

10
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.370
the necessary frameworks
and controls.

11
00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:29.985
In this video, we'll discuss
how security professionals

12
00:00:29.985 --> 00:00:33.775
use frameworks to continuously
identify and manage risk.

13
00:00:33.775 --> 00:00:35.540
We'll also cover how to use

14
00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.140
security controls to manage
or reduce specific risks.

15
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.359
Security frameworks
are guidelines

16
00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:42.590
used for building plans

17
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.024
to help mitigate risks and
threats to data and privacy.

18
00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:49.115
Security frameworks provide
a structured approach

19
00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:51.310
to implementing a
security lifecycle.

20
00:00:51.310 --> 00:00:52.910
The security lifecycle is

21
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:55.160
a constantly evolving
set of policies

22
00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:56.840
and standards that define

23
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.195
how an organization
manages risks,

24
00:00:59.195 --> 00:01:01.280
follows established guidelines,

25
00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:04.975
and meets regulatory
compliance, or laws.

26
00:01:05.975 --> 00:01:07.340
There are several
security frameworks

27
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:08.600
that may be used to manage

28
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.460
different types
of organizational

29
00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.890
and regulatory compliance risks.

30
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.400
The purpose of security
frameworks include protecting

31
00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.450
personally identifiable
information, known as PII,

32
00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:22.670
securing financial information,

33
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.145
identifying security weaknesses,

34
00:01:25.145 --> 00:01:27.650
managing organizational risks,

35
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.910
and aligning security
with business goals.

36
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:34.610
Frameworks have four
core components and

37
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.260
understanding them
will allow you to

38
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.570
better manage potential risks.

39
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.790
The first core component is

40
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.795
identifying and documenting
security goals.

41
00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:47.795
For example, an organization
may have a goal to

42
00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:51.770
align with the E.U.'s General
Data Protection Regulation,

43
00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.640
also known as GDPR.

44
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:58.880
GDPR is a data protection
law established to

45
00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.565
grant European
citizens more control

46
00:02:01.565 --> 00:02:03.425
over their personal data.

47
00:02:03.425 --> 00:02:07.400
A security analyst may be
asked to identify and document

48
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.260
areas where an organization

49
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.425
is out of compliance with GDPR.

50
00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:14.720
The second core
component is setting

51
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.155
guidelines to achieve
security goals.

52
00:02:17.155 --> 00:02:19.280
For example, when implementing

53
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.310
guidelines to achieve
GDPR compliance,

54
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:24.890
your organization
may need to develop

55
00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:26.690
new policies for how to handle

56
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.335
data requests from
individual users.

57
00:02:30.335 --> 00:02:32.510
The third core component
of security frameworks is

58
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.780
implementing strong
security processes.

59
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.360
In the case of GDPR,

60
00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.370
a security analyst working for

61
00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.070
a social media company
may help design

62
00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.110
procedures to ensure
the organization

63
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.220
complies with verified
user data requests.

64
00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.830
An example of this type
of request is when a user

65
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.970
attempts to update or delete
their profile information.

66
00:02:56.970 --> 00:02:58.310
The last core component of

67
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.870
security frameworks is

68
00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.450
monitoring and
communicating results.

69
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.970
As an example, you may monitor

70
00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.730
your organization's
internal network and report

71
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.650
a potential security
issue affecting

72
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:14.325
GDPR to your manager or
regulatory compliance officer.

73
00:03:15.325 --> 00:03:16.150
Now that we've introduced

74
00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:18.955
the four core components
of security frameworks,

75
00:03:18.955 --> 00:03:20.795
let's tie them all together.

76
00:03:20.795 --> 00:03:23.785
Frameworks allow analysts
to work alongside

77
00:03:23.785 --> 00:03:26.665
other members of the
security team to document,

78
00:03:26.665 --> 00:03:28.750
implement, and use the policies

79
00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.909
and procedures that
have been created.

80
00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:34.449
It's essential for an entry-level
analyst to understand

81
00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:36.670
this process because
it directly affects

82
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.985
the work they do and how they
collaborate with others.

83
00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:43.305
Next, we'll discuss
security controls.

84
00:03:44.305 --> 00:03:45.670
Security controls are safeguards

85
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:48.770
designed to reduce
specific security risks.

86
00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:50.770
For example, your company

87
00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:52.450
may have a guideline
that requires

88
00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:54.025
all employees to complete

89
00:03:54.025 --> 00:03:57.345
a privacy training to reduce
the risk of data breaches.

90
00:03:57.345 --> 00:03:59.225
As a security analyst,

91
00:03:59.225 --> 00:04:01.940
you may use a software
tool to automatically

92
00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.560
assign and track which

93
00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.810
employees have completed
this training.

94
00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.300
Security frameworks
and controls are

95
00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:10.685
vital to managing
security for all types of

96
00:04:10.685 --> 00:04:13.370
organizations and
ensuring that everyone is

97
00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:16.355
doing their part to maintain
a low level of risk.

98
00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:18.380
Understanding their
purpose and how

99
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.450
they are used allows analysts to

100
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:22.850
support an organization's
security goals

101
00:04:22.850 --> 00:04:25.190
and protect the
people it serves.

102
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:26.915
In the following videos,

103
00:04:26.915 --> 00:04:28.880
we'll discuss some
well-known frameworks

104
00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:30.650
and principles that
analysts need to

105
00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:35.310
be aware of to minimize risk
and protect data and users.
