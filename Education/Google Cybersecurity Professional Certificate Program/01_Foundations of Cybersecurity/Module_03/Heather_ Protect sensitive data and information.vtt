Hello, my name is Heather and

2
00:00:06.366 --> 00:00:09.709
I'm the Vice President of
Security Engineering at Google.

3
00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:12.367
PII has been an important
topic on the internet

4
00:00:12.367 --> 00:00:14.555
since the beginning of the internet.

5
00:00:14.555 --> 00:00:18.879
And we have been talking about
increasingly sophisticated ways to protect

6
00:00:18.879 --> 00:00:20.122
that data over time.

7
00:00:20.122 --> 00:00:23.811
When we think about collecting
PII on behalf of another person,

8
00:00:23.811 --> 00:00:27.843
we should make sure we're very
deliberate about how it's handled and

9
00:00:27.843 --> 00:00:32.460
where it's stored, and that we understand
where it's stored all the time.

10
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.484
Depending on what kind of role you're in,

11
00:00:35.484 --> 00:00:41.070
you might also need to protect that
data to comply with regulation or law.

12
00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.076
And so, it's important to understand
how the data relates to some of those

13
00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:46.070
obligations.

14
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:49.178
If an organization fails
to meet their obligations,

15
00:00:49.178 --> 00:00:51.570
a number of things might happen.

16
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:56.622
First, you might see a government
regulator become more interested in

17
00:00:56.622 --> 00:01:01.684
understanding the practices around
how a company is handling data.

18
00:01:01.684 --> 00:01:07.431
Secondly, consumers, customers,
businesses may actually begin

19
00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:12.968
to directly inquire of the company
how they're handling data.

20
00:01:12.968 --> 00:01:17.182
And this may become part of
the customer relationship and

21
00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:21.570
increasingly important if
that data is very sensitive.

22
00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:27.634
And third,
the last consequence is legal action.

23
00:01:27.634 --> 00:01:32.603
And it's not uncommon for
us to see victims of cybersecurity

24
00:01:32.603 --> 00:01:37.950
incidents now suing companies for
mishandling their data.

25
00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.475
You can keep up to date with compliance,
regulation and laws around PII

26
00:01:43.475 --> 00:01:50.122
by consulting the relevant website in the
jurisdiction that you have a question for.

27
00:01:50.122 --> 00:01:54.230
Many government websites now
post the laws, regulations, and

28
00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.158
compliance requirements for
data that's being handled.

29
00:01:58.158 --> 00:02:04.177
The regulations and laws that govern how
PII can be handled are very complex,

30
00:02:04.177 --> 00:02:07.511
all over the world, countries, states,

31
00:02:07.511 --> 00:02:11.570
counties are regulating
it at different levels.

32
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:16.021
It's important to understand and
to be aware that these laws exist.

33
00:02:16.021 --> 00:02:19.912
However, if you need to ask
a question about a specific law,

34
00:02:19.912 --> 00:02:25.618
it's important to seek advice from legal
counsel for that particular jurisdiction.

35
00:02:25.618 --> 00:02:29.000
It may be very different than
the jurisdiction that you're in.
