00:00:01.137 --> 00:00:04.409
With the expansion of
reliable high-speed internet,

2
00:00:04.409 --> 00:00:08.945
the number of computers connected to
the internet increased dramatically.

3
00:00:08.945 --> 00:00:12.217
Because malware could spread
through the internet,

4
00:00:12.217 --> 00:00:16.665
threat actors no longer needed to use
physical disks to spread viruses.

5
00:00:17.665 --> 00:00:20.025
To better understand
attacks in the digital age,

6
00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:24.429
we'll discuss two notable attacks
that relied on the internet:

7
00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:29.333
the LoveLetter attack and
the Equifax breach.

8
00:00:30.333 --> 00:00:33.161
In the year 2000,
Onel De Guzman created the LoveLetter

9
00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:37.086
malware to steal
internet login credentials.

10
00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:41.516
This attack spread rapidly and
took advantage of people who had not

11
00:00:41.516 --> 00:00:45.327
developed a healthy suspicion for
unsolicited emails.

12
00:00:45.327 --> 00:00:49.024
Users received an email with
the subject line, "I Love You."

13
00:00:49.024 --> 00:00:53.125
Each email contained an attachment
labeled, "Love Letter For You."

14
00:00:53.125 --> 00:00:58.127
When the attachment was opened,
the malware scanned a user's address book.

15
00:00:58.127 --> 00:01:02.143
Then, it automatically sent itself
to each person on the list and

16
00:01:02.143 --> 00:01:06.348
installed a program to collect
user information and passwords.

17
00:01:06.348 --> 00:01:10.613
Recipients would think they were
receiving an email from a friend, but

18
00:01:10.613 --> 00:01:12.239
it was actually malware.

19
00:01:12.239 --> 00:01:16.956
The LoveLetter ended up infecting
45 million computers globally

20
00:01:16.956 --> 00:01:22.252
and is believed to have caused over
$10 billion dollars in damages.

21
00:01:22.252 --> 00:01:26.250
The LoveLetter attack is the first
example of social engineering.

22
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.853
Social engineering is a manipulation
technique that exploits

23
00:01:30.853 --> 00:01:35.817
human error to gain private information,
access, or valuables.

24
00:01:36.817 --> 00:01:37.282
After the LoveLetter,

25
00:01:37.282 --> 00:01:40.805
attackers understood the power
of social engineering.

26
00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:45.651
The number of social engineering
attacks is increasing with every new

27
00:01:45.651 --> 00:01:50.672
social media application that allows
public access to people's data.

28
00:01:50.672 --> 00:01:55.016
Many people are now prioritizing
convenience over privacy.

29
00:01:55.016 --> 00:01:59.924
The trade-off of this evolving shift
is that these tools may lead to

30
00:01:59.924 --> 00:02:04.843
increased vulnerability, if people
do not use them appropriately.

31
00:02:05.843 --> 00:02:08.999
As a security professional,
your role is to identify and

32
00:02:08.999 --> 00:02:14.630
manage inappropriate use of technology
that may place your organization and

33
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.761
all the people associated with it at risk.

34
00:02:17.761 --> 00:02:23.854
One way to safeguard your organization is
to conduct regular internal trainings,

35
00:02:23.854 --> 00:02:29.521
which you as a future security analyst
may be asked to lead or participate in.

36
00:02:30.521 --> 00:02:31.273
Today, it's common for

37
00:02:31.273 --> 00:02:36.874
employees to receive training on how
to identify social engineering attacks.

38
00:02:36.874 --> 00:02:40.480
Specifically, phishing through
the emails they receive.

39
00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:45.392
Phishing is the use of digital
communications to trick people into

40
00:02:45.392 --> 00:02:49.965
revealing sensitive data or
deploying malicious software.

41
00:02:50.965 --> 00:02:53.148
Now, let's discuss the Equifax breach.

42
00:02:53.148 --> 00:02:54.243
In 2017,

43
00:02:54.243 --> 00:03:00.192
attackers successfully infiltrated
the credit reporting agency, Equifax.

44
00:03:00.192 --> 00:03:05.906
This resulted in one of the largest known
data breaches of sensitive information.

45
00:03:05.906 --> 00:03:10.675
Over 143 million customer
records were stolen, and

46
00:03:10.675 --> 00:03:15.959
the breach affected approximately
40% of all Americans.

47
00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.519
The records included personally
identifiable information including

48
00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:25.079
social security numbers, birth dates,
driver's license numbers,

49
00:03:25.079 --> 00:03:27.897
home addresses, and credit card numbers.

50
00:03:27.897 --> 00:03:29.955
From a security standpoint,

51
00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:34.576
the breach occurred due to multiple
failures on Equifax's part.

52
00:03:34.576 --> 00:03:39.333
It wasn't just one vulnerability that
the attackers took advantage of,

53
00:03:39.333 --> 00:03:40.719
there were several.

54
00:03:40.719 --> 00:03:45.170
The company failed to take the actions
needed to fix multiple known

55
00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.314
vulnerabilities in the months
leading up to the data breach.

56
00:03:50.314 --> 00:03:53.796
In the end,
Equifax settled with the U.S. government and

57
00:03:53.796 --> 00:04:00.822
paid over $575 million dollars to resolve customer
complaints and cover required fines.

58
00:04:01.822 --> 00:04:06.249
While there have been other data breaches
before and after the Equifax breach,

59
00:04:06.249 --> 00:04:10.707
the large settlement with the U.S.
government alerted companies to

60
00:04:10.707 --> 00:04:16.397
the financial impact of a breach and the
need to implement preventative measures.

61
00:04:17.397 --> 00:04:20.639
These are just a couple of well-known
incidents that have shaped

62
00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.267
the security industry.

63
00:04:22.267 --> 00:04:26.158
Knowing about them will help
you in your security career.

64
00:04:26.158 --> 00:04:31.203
Understanding different types of malware
and social engineering attacks will

65
00:04:31.203 --> 00:04:36.183
allow you to communicate about security
risks during future job interviews.

66
00:04:37.183 --> 00:04:41.536
As a future security professional,
constantly adapting and educating

67
00:04:41.536 --> 00:04:47.339
yourself on threat actors' tactics and
techniques will be a part of your job.

68
00:04:47.339 --> 00:04:52.012
By noticing similar trends,
patterns, and methodologies,

69
00:04:52.012 --> 00:04:57.312
you may be able to identify a potential
breach and limit future damage.

70
00:04:58.312 --> 00:05:02.216
Finally, understanding how
security affects people's lives is

71
00:05:02.216 --> 00:05:06.513
a good reminder of why the work
you will do is so important!
