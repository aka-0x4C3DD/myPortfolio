Hi, my name is Sean.

2
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.655
I'm a Technical Program
Manager in Google workspace.

3
00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:13.965
I am a 30 year security veteran

4
00:00:13.965 --> 00:00:16.470
within the security space

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.035
across six different industries.

6
00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:20.955
During your first data breach,

7
00:00:20.955 --> 00:00:22.710
the most important
thing that you can

8
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.650
do is keep your cool.

9
00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:30.220
Everyone around is going
to be freaking out.

10
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:31.500
If you are on

11
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.070
the security team and you
are managing the incident,

12
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:38.805
you have to legitimately be
the cool guy in the room.

13
00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:44.325
Be that person that has the
pause in the conversation.

14
00:00:44.325 --> 00:00:47.500
Somebody might be like, do
you know what's going on?

15
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.590
I absolutely do.

16
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.100
I think the biggest
breach I've ever

17
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.980
had was a phone call.

18
00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.380
An engineer for
another financial,

19
00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.840
bought a server off eBay.

20
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.080
That server fired it
up hadn't been wiped.

21
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.400
Twenty million credit
card records were on it.

22
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:11.095
That triggered a whole review

23
00:01:11.095 --> 00:01:13.480
of we had not been controlling

24
00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.460
for how do third parties because

25
00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:17.685
we were now outsourcing
data centers.

26
00:01:17.685 --> 00:01:19.090
How do third parties wipe

27
00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.140
the servers that
we no longer use?

28
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.030
The first thing
you're going to do

29
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.430
is to contain the breach.

30
00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:28.310
If you are still
hemorrhaging data,

31
00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:29.630
you go through your progressions

32
00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.405
to stop hemorrhaging data.

33
00:01:31.405 --> 00:01:33.515
So if that means shutting
down a server,

34
00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:37.070
shutting down a data
center, shutting down comms,

35
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:40.580
whatever, stopping the data loss is

36
00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.040
that is your number
one priority.

37
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.330
Your job as an incident manager
or as somebody working

38
00:01:47.330 --> 00:01:49.220
a breach is to stop

39
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.305
the breach and then
investigate the breach.

40
00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:57.470
So executing your incident
management by plan is

41
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.900
the most important thing that

42
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:03.570
an entry level person
can keep in mind.
