00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.945
Welcome back! When it
comes to security,

2
00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:05.910
there is so much
to learn, and I'm

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.340
thrilled to be part of
your career journey.

4
00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:10.395
This is such an exciting time

5
00:00:10.395 --> 00:00:11.985
to be learning about security!

6
00:00:11.985 --> 00:00:14.790
When I learned about
international hacks that

7
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.620
impacted both private companies

8
00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:18.345
and government organizations,

9
00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:21.510
I was inspired to want to
work in security because I

10
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.170
realized how dynamic and
important this field is.

11
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:27.090
One reason there are

12
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:30.360
so many jobs in the
security field today,

13
00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:32.580
is because of attacks
that happened in

14
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.130
the 1980s and 1990s.

15
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:37.860
Decades later,
security professionals

16
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.750
are still actively working to

17
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.295
protect organizations and people

18
00:00:42.295 --> 00:00:45.130
from variations of these
early computer attacks.

19
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.835
In this section of the course,

20
00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:48.590
we'll discuss viruses and

21
00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:52.400
malware, and introduce the
concept of social engineering.

22
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.500
Then, we'll discuss how

23
00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:58.195
the digital age ushered in
a new era of threat actors.

24
00:00:58.195 --> 00:01:00.740
Knowing the evolution
of each attack is

25
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:03.890
key to protecting
against future attacks.

26
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:05.900
Lastly, we'll provide

27
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.950
an overview of eight
security domains.

28
00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:12.025
Next up, we'll
travel back in time,

29
00:01:12.025 --> 00:01:13.999
to explore some of the viruses,

30
00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:16.505
data breaches, and
malware attacks

31
00:01:16.505 --> 00:01:20.190
that have helped shape the
industry as we know it today.
