00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:06.810
As the tactics of threat actors evolve, so
do the roles of security professionals.

2
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:11.253
Having a solid understanding of core
security concepts will support your growth

3
00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:12.140
in this field.

4
00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.595
One way to better understand
these core concepts is by

5
00:00:15.595 --> 00:00:20.200
organizing them into categories,
called security domains.

6
00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.660
As of 2022, CISSP has defined eight domains

7
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:29.550
to organize the work of
security professionals.

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.518
It's important to understand that these
domains are related and that gaps in one

9
00:00:34.518 --> 00:00:38.986
domain can result in negative
consequences to an entire organization.

10
00:00:39.986 --> 00:00:42.891
It's also important to understand
the domains because it may help

11
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:47.578
you better understand your career goals
and your role within an organization.

12
00:00:47.578 --> 00:00:50.847
As you learn more about
the elements of each domain,

13
00:00:50.847 --> 00:00:54.799
the work involved in one may appeal
to you more than the others.

14
00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:59.617
This domain may become a career path for
you to explore further.

15
00:01:00.617 --> 00:01:03.155
CISSP defines eight domains in total, and

16
00:01:03.155 --> 00:01:09.150
we'll discuss all eight between
this video and the next.

17
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.590
In this video, we're going to
cover the first four:

18
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:17.032
security and risk management,
asset security,

19
00:01:17.032 --> 00:01:22.950
security architecture and engineering,
and communication and network security.

20
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:27.340
Let's start with the first domain,
security and risk management.

21
00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.649
Security and risk management focuses on
defining security goals and objectives,

22
00:01:33.649 --> 00:01:38.880
risk mitigation, compliance,
business continuity, and the law.

23
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.526
For example, security analysts may
need to update company policies

24
00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:46.500
related to private health information

25
00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.286
if a change is made to a federal
compliance regulation such as

26
00:01:50.286 --> 00:01:56.310
the Health Insurance Portability and
Accountability Act, also known as HIPAA.

27
00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:59.303
The second domain is asset security.

28
00:01:59.303 --> 00:02:05.050
This domain focuses on securing
digital and physical assets.

29
00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:09.826
It's also related to the storage,
maintenance, retention, and

30
00:02:09.826 --> 00:02:12.130
destruction of data.

31
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:16.695
When working with this domain,
security analysts may be tasked with

32
00:02:16.695 --> 00:02:20.552
making sure that old equipment
is properly disposed of and

33
00:02:20.552 --> 00:02:24.663
destroyed, including any type
of confidential information.

34
00:02:25.663 --> 00:02:29.594
The third domain is security
architecture and engineering.

35
00:02:29.594 --> 00:02:35.712
This domain focuses on optimizing data
security by ensuring effective tools,

36
00:02:35.712 --> 00:02:38.557
systems, and processes are in place.

37
00:02:38.557 --> 00:02:43.809
As a security analyst, you may be
tasked with configuring a firewall.

38
00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:47.854
A firewall is a device used to monitor and
filter incoming and

39
00:02:47.854 --> 00:02:50.405
outgoing computer network traffic.

40
00:02:50.405 --> 00:02:54.714
Setting up a firewall correctly helps
prevent attacks that could affect

41
00:02:54.714 --> 00:02:56.310
productivity.

42
00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.740
The fourth security domain is
communication and network security.

43
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.099
This domain focuses on managing and
securing physical networks and

44
00:03:05.099 --> 00:03:07.860
wireless communications.

45
00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.395
As a security analyst,

46
00:03:09.395 --> 00:03:13.861
you may be asked to analyze user
behavior within your organization.

47
00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.840
Imagine discovering that users are
connecting to unsecured wireless hotspots.

48
00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.200
This could leave the organization and
its employees vulnerable to attacks.

49
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:31.028
To ensure communications are secure,
you would create a network policy to

50
00:03:31.028 --> 00:03:33.253
prevent and mitigate exposure.

51
00:03:34.253 --> 00:03:37.554
Maintaining an organization's
security is a team effort, and

52
00:03:37.554 --> 00:03:39.758
there are many moving parts.

53
00:03:39.758 --> 00:03:44.201
As an entry-level analyst, you will
continue to develop your skills

54
00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:48.500
by learning how to mitigate risks
to keep people and data safe.

55
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.230
You don't need to be an expert in all
domains. But, having a basic understanding

56
00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.460
of them will aid you in your
journey as a security professional.

57
00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.813
You're doing great! We have just
introduced the first four security

58
00:04:01.813 --> 00:04:05.440
domains, and
in the next video, we'll discuss four more!

59
00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.690
See you soon!
