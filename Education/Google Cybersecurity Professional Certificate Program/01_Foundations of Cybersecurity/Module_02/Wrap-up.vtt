00:00:00.955 --> 00:00:06.168
This concludes our brief introduction
to some of the most influential

2
00:00:06.168 --> 00:00:11.749
security attacks throughout history and
CISSP's eight security domains.

3
00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:13.747
Let's review what we've discussed.

4
00:00:14.747 --> 00:00:18.687
First, we covered viruses, including
the Brain virus and the Morris worm,

5
00:00:18.687 --> 00:00:23.704
and discussed how these early forms of
malware shaped the security industry.

6
00:00:23.704 --> 00:00:29.431
We also discussed how many attacks today
are variants of these early examples.

7
00:00:29.431 --> 00:00:33.959
Understanding previous attacks is
critical for security professionals who

8
00:00:33.959 --> 00:00:38.776
are working to protect organizations and
people from possible future variants.

9
00:00:39.776 --> 00:00:42.824
We also discussed social engineering and
threat actor motives

10
00:00:42.824 --> 00:00:47.339
by learning about the LoveLetter
attack and the Equifax data breach.

11
00:00:47.339 --> 00:00:50.667
These incidents showed
the widespread impacts and

12
00:00:50.667 --> 00:00:55.318
associated costs of more recent
security breaches in the digital age.

13
00:00:56.318 --> 00:01:00.451
Finally, we introduced CISSP's eight
security domains and how they can be

14
00:01:00.451 --> 00:01:05.935
used to categorize different areas of
focus within the security profession.

15
00:01:06.935 --> 00:01:10.066
I hope you're feeling confident about
your foundational security knowledge!

16
00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:14.565
Learning the history of security can allow
you to better understand the current

17
00:01:14.565 --> 00:01:15.246
industry.

18
00:01:15.246 --> 00:01:19.700
CISSP's eight security domains
provide a way to organize

19
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.740
the work of security professionals.

20
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:26.494
Remember, every security
professional is essential.

21
00:01:26.494 --> 00:01:32.113
Your unique point of view, professional
background, and knowledge are valuable.

22
00:01:32.113 --> 00:01:35.063
So, the diversity you bring
to the field will further

23
00:01:35.063 --> 00:01:39.807
improve the security industry as you work
to keep organizations and people safe.
