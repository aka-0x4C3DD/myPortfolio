00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.260
The security industry
is constantly evolving,

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.560
but many present-day attacks
are not entirely new.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.745
Attackers often alter or
enhance previous methods.

4
00:00:11.745 --> 00:00:14.040
Understanding past attacks can

5
00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.170
provide direction
for how to handle

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.000
or investigate incidents in

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.430
your job as a security analyst.

8
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.535
First, let's go over
a couple of key terms

9
00:00:23.535 --> 00:00:25.425
that will support
your understanding

10
00:00:25.425 --> 00:00:27.375
of the attacks we'll discuss.

11
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.040
A computer virus is

12
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.410
malicious code written
to interfere with

13
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:33.420
computer operations and cause

14
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.970
damage to data and software.

15
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:38.300
The virus attaches itself to

16
00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:41.570
programs or documents
on a computer,

17
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.640
then spreads and infects

18
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.580
one or more computers
in a network.

19
00:00:46.975 --> 00:00:50.550
Today, viruses are more commonly
referred to as malware,

20
00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.350
which is software designed
to harm devices or networks.

21
00:00:55.025 --> 00:00:58.224
Two examples of early
malware attacks that we'll

22
00:00:58.224 --> 00:01:01.150
cover are the Brain virus
and the Morris worm.

23
00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.600
They were created by

24
00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.160
malware developers to
accomplish specific tasks.

25
00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.430
However, the developers
underestimated the impact

26
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.209
their malware would
have and the amount

27
00:01:12.209 --> 00:01:14.480
of infected computers
there would be.

28
00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.260
Let's take a closer look
at these attacks and

29
00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.260
discuss how they helped shape

30
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.250
security as we know it today.

31
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:25.150
In 1986, the Alvi brothers
created the Brain virus,

32
00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.510
although the intention of
the virus was to track

33
00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:30.225
illegal copies of
medical software

34
00:01:30.225 --> 00:01:32.580
and prevent pirated licenses,

35
00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.500
what the virus actually
did was unexpected.

36
00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:39.550
Once a person used a pirated
copy of the software,

37
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:40.340
the virus-infected

38
00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:41.605
that computer.

39
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.080
Then, any disk that was

40
00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.205
inserted into the computer
was also infected.

41
00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.014
The virus spread
to a new computer

42
00:01:49.014 --> 00:01:53.500
every time someone used
one of the infected disks.

43
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.500
Undetected, the virus

44
00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:58.500
spread globally within
a couple of months.

45
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:00.250
Although the
intention was not to

46
00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.550
destroy data or hardware,

47
00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:05.530
the virus slowed down
productivity and

48
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:08.550
significantly impacted
business operations.

49
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.170
The Brain virus fundamentally

50
00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:12.750
altered the computing industry,

51
00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.110
emphasizing the
need for a plan to

52
00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.250
maintain security
and productivity.

53
00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.250
As a security analyst,

54
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:22.150
you will follow and maintain

55
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.220
strategies put in
place to ensure

56
00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:26.335
your organization has a plan

57
00:02:26.335 --> 00:02:28.500
to keep their data
and people safe.

58
00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:32.450
Another influential computer
attack was the Morris worm.

59
00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:35.550
In 1988, Robert Morris developed

60
00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.550
a program to assess the
size of the internet.

61
00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.475
The program crawled the web
and installed itself onto

62
00:02:42.475 --> 00:02:44.400
other computers to
tally the number

63
00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.615
of computers that were
connected to the internet.

64
00:02:47.455 --> 00:02:49.085
Sounds simple, right?

65
00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:51.040
The program, however, failed to

66
00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.185
keep track of the
computers it had

67
00:02:53.185 --> 00:02:56.350
already compromised and
continued to re-install

68
00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:00.250
itself until the computers ran
out of memory and crashed.

69
00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.370
About 6,000 computers
were affected,

70
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:06.415
representing 10% of the
internet at the time.

71
00:03:06.575 --> 00:03:10.050
This attack cost millions of
dollars in damages due to

72
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:12.240
business disruptions
and the efforts

73
00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.050
required to remove the worm.

74
00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:15.750
After the Morris worm,

75
00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:18.250
Computer Emergency
Response Teams,

76
00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:20.300
known as CERTsÂ®, were

77
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:23.550
established to respond to
computer security incidents.

78
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.750
CERTs still exist today,

79
00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:28.250
but their place in the
security industry has

80
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.150
expanded to include
more responsibilities.

81
00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.190
Later in this program,

82
00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.300
you'll learn more about

83
00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.300
the core functions of
these security teams

84
00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.250
and gain hands-on practice

85
00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:41.550
with detection and
response tools.

86
00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:44.230
Early attacks played a key role

87
00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.300
in shaping the current
security industry.

88
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:48.260
And coming up, we'll discuss how

89
00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:52.440
attacks evolved in
the digital age.
