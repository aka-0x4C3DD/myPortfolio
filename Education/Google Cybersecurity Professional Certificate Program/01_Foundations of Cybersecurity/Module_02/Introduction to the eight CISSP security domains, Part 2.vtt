00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.035
Welcome back. In the last video,

2
00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:07.710
we introduced you to the
first four security domains.

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.170
In this video, we'll introduce

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.615
you to the next four
security domains:

5
00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:14.910
identity and access management,

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.415
security assessment and testing,

7
00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:21.600
security operations, and
software development security.

8
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.390
Familiarizing yourself
with these domains will

9
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.360
allow you to navigate the
complex world of security.

10
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.420
The domains outline and organize

11
00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.615
how a team of security
professionals work together.

12
00:00:32.615 --> 00:00:34.910
Depending on the organization,

13
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.670
analyst roles may sit
at the intersection of

14
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.315
multiple domains or focus
on one specific domain.

15
00:00:41.315 --> 00:00:43.490
Knowing where a particular role

16
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.470
fits within the
security landscape

17
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.465
will help you prepare
for job interviews

18
00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:49.780
and work as part of a
full security team.

19
00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.040
Let's move into
the fifth domain:

20
00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.320
identity and access management.

21
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.435
Identity and access management

22
00:00:56.435 --> 00:00:58.820
focuses on keeping
data secure, by

23
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.250
ensuring users follow
established policies

24
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.350
to control and manage
physical assets,

25
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.345
like office spaces, and

26
00:01:05.345 --> 00:01:09.215
logical assets, such as
networks and applications.

27
00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:11.240
Validating the identities of

28
00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.700
employees and
documenting access roles

29
00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.050
are essential to maintaining

30
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.190
the organization's physical
and digital security.

31
00:01:18.190 --> 00:01:21.380
For example, as a
security analyst,

32
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.300
you may be tasked
with setting up

33
00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:26.045
employees' keycard
access to buildings.

34
00:01:27.045 --> 00:01:29.905
The sixth domain is security
assessment and testing.

35
00:01:29.905 --> 00:01:31.610
This domain focuses on

36
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.920
conducting security
control testing,

37
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.860
collecting and analyzing
data, and conducting

38
00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.660
security audits to monitor for

39
00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.915
risks, threats, and
vulnerabilities.

40
00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:45.590
Security analysts may
conduct regular audits of

41
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.990
user permissions,
to make sure that

42
00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.875
users have the correct
level of access.

43
00:01:50.875 --> 00:01:53.510
For example, access to

44
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.370
payroll information is often

45
00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.350
limited to certain employees, so

46
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.010
analysts may be asked to
regularly audit permissions to

47
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:03.365
ensure that no
unauthorized person

48
00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:05.525
can view employee salaries.

49
00:02:06.525 --> 00:02:08.985
The seventh domain is
security operations.

50
00:02:08.985 --> 00:02:11.360
This domain focuses
on conducting

51
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.140
investigations and implementing
preventative measures.

52
00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:18.260
Imagine that you, as
a security analyst,

53
00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.580
receive an alert that

54
00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:21.230
an unknown device has been

55
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:23.675
connected to your
internal network.

56
00:02:23.675 --> 00:02:26.990
You would need to follow
the organization's policies

57
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:30.360
and procedures to quickly
stop the potential threat.

58
00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:34.615
The final, eighth domain is
software development security.

59
00:02:34.615 --> 00:02:38.480
This domain focuses on using
secure coding practices,

60
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.240
which are a set of recommended
guidelines that are used

61
00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.434
to create secure
applications and services.

62
00:02:44.434 --> 00:02:46.970
A security analyst may work with

63
00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.220
software development
teams to ensure

64
00:02:49.220 --> 00:02:51.365
security practices
are incorporated

65
00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:54.175
into the software
development life-cycle.

66
00:02:54.175 --> 00:02:56.095
If, for example,

67
00:02:56.095 --> 00:02:59.945
one of your partner teams is
creating a new mobile app,

68
00:02:59.945 --> 00:03:01.700
then you may be asked to

69
00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.040
advise on the
password policies or

70
00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.900
ensure that any user data is

71
00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.650
properly secured and managed.

72
00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:11.070
That ends our introduction to

73
00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:14.910
CISSP's eight security domains.

74
00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:17.810
Challenge yourself to
better understand each of

75
00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.670
these domains and
how they affect

76
00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:22.295
the overall security
of an organization.

77
00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:24.380
While they may still be a bit

78
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:26.705
unclear to you this
early in the program,

79
00:03:26.705 --> 00:03:28.610
these domains will
be discussed in

80
00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.850
greater detail in the next
course. See you there!
