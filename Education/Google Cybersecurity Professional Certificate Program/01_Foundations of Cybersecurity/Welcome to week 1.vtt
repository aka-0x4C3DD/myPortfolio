00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.720
Hi again! Now that you have

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.975
some idea of what to expect
from the program as a whole,

3
00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:08.820
let's discuss more about

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.830
what you'll learn
in this course.

5
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:12.930
This course will
introduce you to

6
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:15.000
the world of security
and how it's used

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.035
to protect business
operations, users, and devices, so

8
00:00:19.035 --> 00:00:20.970
you can contribute
to the creation

9
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.175
of a safer internet for all.

10
00:00:24.175 --> 00:00:24.780
In this section, we'll

11
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.390
cover foundational
security concepts.

12
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.210
First, we'll define security.

13
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:32.100
Then, we'll explore

14
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.774
common job responsibilities
of security analysts.

15
00:00:35.774 --> 00:00:38.295
Building on that, we'll cover

16
00:00:38.295 --> 00:00:41.490
core skills a security
analyst may have.

17
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.210
Finally, we'll
discuss the value of

18
00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.855
security for protecting
organizations and people.

19
00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:51.640
Later on, we'll cover
eight security domains.

20
00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.240
Then, we'll cover common security
frameworks and controls.

21
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.370
Finally, we'll wrap up

22
00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.560
the course by
discussing common tools

23
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.540
and programming languages that

24
00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.455
entry-level security
analysts may use.

25
00:01:06.455 --> 00:01:08.630
Coming up, we'll go over
some resources that

26
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:11.765
will allow you to get the
most out of this program.

27
00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:13.880
I'm really excited
for you to start

28
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.530
this journey--let's begin!
