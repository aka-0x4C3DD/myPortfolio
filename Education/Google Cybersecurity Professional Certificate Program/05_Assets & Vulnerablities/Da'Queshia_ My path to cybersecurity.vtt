Hi. My name is Da'Queshia.

2
00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:07.950
I'm a security engineer.

3
00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.230
That basically means
I work securing

4
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.055
Google's products so users
like you aren't vulnerable.

5
00:00:14.055 --> 00:00:16.245
Before I entered cybersecurity,

6
00:00:16.245 --> 00:00:18.165
I worked installing Internet.

7
00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:20.265
I also worked at a chip factory.

8
00:00:20.265 --> 00:00:21.855
I worked in fast food.

9
00:00:21.855 --> 00:00:23.760
I sold shoes at the mall.

10
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.970
I did a lot of things
before I made it here.

11
00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.010
A lot of what I learned
in my past jobs

12
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:29.735
I actually use every day.

13
00:00:29.735 --> 00:00:33.650
Some of it is my soft skills
like time management,

14
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.355
people skills, and
communication.

15
00:00:36.355 --> 00:00:38.420
As a new cybersecurity analyst,

16
00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:41.689
it's important to be able to
communicate, take feedback,

17
00:00:41.689 --> 00:00:45.150
and feel uncomfortable, not
with the people around you,

18
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.530
but with the problems
you're trying to

19
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:47.840
solve because sometimes it

20
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:49.340
requires you to think outside of

21
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:50.880
the box and be challenged.

22
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:52.340
I would describe my job as a

23
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.140
Google security guard because

24
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.620
I work on the Gmail
security team,

25
00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.880
it's my job to protect Gmail.

26
00:00:57.880 --> 00:00:59.795
Some of those threats are

27
00:00:59.795 --> 00:01:01.490
people who are sending
you bad emails,

28
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:03.215
who are trying to get
your user credentials

29
00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:05.885
or get you to click
on a phishing link.

30
00:01:05.885 --> 00:01:07.520
When it comes to
vulnerabilities,

31
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:08.600
some of those could be something

32
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.130
like unsanitized input,

33
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.650
which can lead to trouble.

34
00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:14.010
My typical work day starts
like everyone else.

35
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.260
I check my emails and

36
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.480
then from there I go
into my bug queue;

37
00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:18.980
it's essentially when
people tell me

38
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.730
there's a problem with
one of our products.

39
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:22.820
I start doing a little
bit of research and then

40
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.950
I like to explore the
bug a little bit more.

41
00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.140
I like to figure out if
this can break this,

42
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.460
can it also break this,

43
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.760
and if it can, what
else can I do with it?

44
00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:32.090
Then from there, I look for

45
00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.440
a solution to make
sure that I fix

46
00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.790
that hole and then any other

47
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.770
holes that we might
have in our security.

48
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.300
Some of the things
you learned about in

49
00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:39.800
this course is threat modeling,

50
00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:41.560
and that's something
I use every day.

51
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:43.280
Whenever I get a
bug, it's part of

52
00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.990
my job to figure
out the attack tree

53
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:46.550
and what type of vectors we use

54
00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.560
to take advantage
of vulnerabilities.

55
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.260
No one is born
knowing everything.

56
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:55.175
I know that sounds really
cliche or like super obvious,

57
00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:56.630
but it helps me
because it helps

58
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.190
put some perspective the time

59
00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:59.900
and effort that everyone has to

60
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.260
put in in order to
learn something new.

61
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:04.020
So be patient with yourself.

62
00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.845
Don't let anyone discourage
you from cybersecurity.

63
00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:08.480
Taking this course is one step

64
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.505
closer to getting
into your goal.

65
00:02:10.505 --> 00:02:14.070
Don't get discouraged
now. Keep going.
