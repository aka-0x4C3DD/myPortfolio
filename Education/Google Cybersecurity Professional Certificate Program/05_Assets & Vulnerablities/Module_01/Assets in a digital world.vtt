00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.085
Welcome back! We've covered
a lot of information so far.

2
00:00:05.085 --> 00:00:06.870
I hope you're having as much fun

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.300
exploring the role
of security as I am!

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.610
We've explored what
organizational assets

5
00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.785
are and why they
need protection.

6
00:00:13.785 --> 00:00:15.450
You've also gotten a sense of

7
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:18.775
the tremendous amount of
assets security teams protect.

8
00:00:18.775 --> 00:00:20.315
Previously, we began

9
00:00:20.315 --> 00:00:22.640
examining security
asset management and

10
00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.170
the importance of
keeping track of

11
00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:26.800
everything that's important
to an organization.

12
00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.395
Security teams classify
assets based on value.

13
00:00:30.395 --> 00:00:32.120
Next, let's expand

14
00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:35.180
our security mindset and
think about this question.

15
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.125
What exactly is valuable
about an asset?

16
00:00:39.125 --> 00:00:41.420
These days, the answer
is often information.

17
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.015
Most information is
in a digital form.

18
00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:45.905
We call this data.

19
00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:48.860
Data is information
that is translated,

20
00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:51.625
processed, or stored
by a computer.

21
00:00:51.625 --> 00:00:53.805
We live in a connected world.

22
00:00:53.805 --> 00:00:56.420
Billions of devices around
the world are linked to

23
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:57.740
the internet and are exchanging

24
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.650
data with each
other all the time.

25
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.000
In fact, millions of pieces of

26
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.060
data are being passed to
your device right now!

27
00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.325
When compared to
physical assets,

28
00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:10.010
digital assets have
additional challenges.

29
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.010
What you need to understand
is that protecting data

30
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.385
depends on where that data
is and what it's doing.

31
00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:18.350
Security teams protect data in

32
00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.630
three different states: in use,

33
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:22.505
in transit, and at rest.

34
00:01:22.505 --> 00:01:25.540
Let's investigate this
idea in greater detail.

35
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.110
Data in use is data being
accessed by one or more users.

36
00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.899
Imagine being at a
park with your laptop.

37
00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:34.430
It's a nice sunny day, and you

38
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.365
stop at a bench to
check your email.

39
00:01:36.365 --> 00:01:38.830
This is an example
of data in use.

40
00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:40.295
As soon as you log in,

41
00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:42.920
your inbox is considered
to be in use.

42
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.810
Next, is data in transit.

43
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.810
Data in transit is data
traveling from one point to

44
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.795
another. While you're
signed into your account,

45
00:01:50.795 --> 00:01:52.970
a message from one of
your friends appears.

46
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:54.830
They sent you an
interesting article

47
00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.815
about the growing
security industry.

48
00:01:56.815 --> 00:01:58.295
You decide to reply,

49
00:01:58.295 --> 00:02:00.120
thanking them for
sending this to you.

50
00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.430
When you click send,

51
00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:04.495
this is now an example
of data in transit.

52
00:02:05.495 --> 00:02:07.445
Finally, there's data at rest.

53
00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:11.390
Data at rest is data not
currently being accessed.

54
00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.430
In this state, data is typically

55
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.295
stored on a physical device.

56
00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:17.420
An example of data at
rest would be when you

57
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.180
finish checking your email
and close your laptop.

58
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.280
You then decide to pack up

59
00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.560
and go to a nearby
cafe for breakfast.

60
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:27.530
As you make your way from
the park towards the cafe,

61
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.250
the data in your
laptop is at rest.

62
00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:32.795
So now that we understand
these states of data,

63
00:02:32.795 --> 00:02:35.485
let's connect this back
to asset management.

64
00:02:36.485 --> 00:02:38.300
Earlier, I mentioned that
information is one of

65
00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:41.285
the most valuable assets
that companies can have.

66
00:02:41.285 --> 00:02:44.840
Information security,
or InfoSec, is

67
00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.370
the practice of keeping data in

68
00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.195
all states away from
unauthorized users.

69
00:02:49.195 --> 00:02:52.880
Weak information security
is a serious problem.

70
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.085
It can lead to things
like identity theft,

71
00:02:55.085 --> 00:02:57.925
financial loss, and
reputational damage.

72
00:02:57.925 --> 00:03:01.025
These events have potential
to harm organizations,

73
00:03:01.025 --> 00:03:03.365
their partners, and
their customers.

74
00:03:04.365 --> 00:03:04.940
And there's more to consider in

75
00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:06.800
your work as a security analyst.

76
00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.155
As our digital world
continually changes,

77
00:03:09.155 --> 00:03:12.170
we are adapting our
understanding of data at rest.

78
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.540
Physical devices like
our smartphones

79
00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:16.940
more commonly store
data in the cloud,

80
00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:19.550
meaning that our information
isn't necessarily at

81
00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.675
rest just because our phone
is resting on a table.

82
00:03:22.675 --> 00:03:24.410
We should always be mindful of

83
00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.045
new vulnerabilities as our world

84
00:03:26.045 --> 00:03:28.225
becomes increasingly connected.

85
00:03:29.225 --> 00:03:30.410
Remember, protecting data

86
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.140
depends on where the data
is and what it's doing.

87
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.810
Keeping track of information
is part of the puzzle

88
00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.040
that companies solve when

89
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.965
considering their security plan.

90
00:03:38.965 --> 00:03:41.045
Understanding the
three states of data

91
00:03:41.045 --> 00:03:43.100
enable security teams to analyze

92
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:44.450
risk and determine

93
00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.330
an asset management plan
for different situations.
