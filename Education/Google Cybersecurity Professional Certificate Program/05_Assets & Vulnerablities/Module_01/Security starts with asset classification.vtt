1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.865
It can be really stressful

2
00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:05.460
when you have trouble
finding something important.

3
00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.475
You're late to an appointment
and can't find your keys!

4
00:00:08.475 --> 00:00:09.930
We all find ourselves in

5
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:12.630
situations like these
at one time or another.

6
00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.610
Believe it or not, organizations

7
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.440
deal with the same kind of trouble.

8
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.690
Take a few seconds to
think of the number of

9
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.150
important assets
you have nearby.

10
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.145
I'm thinking of my phone,

11
00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:25.950
wallet, and keys, for example.

12
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.380
Next, imagine that
you've just joined

13
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.155
a security team for a
small online retailer.

14
00:00:31.155 --> 00:00:33.840
The company has been growing
over the past few years,

15
00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:35.785
adding more and more customers.

16
00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:38.580
As a result, they're expanding
their security department

17
00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.505
to protect the increasing
numbers of assets they have.

18
00:00:41.505 --> 00:00:44.705
Let's say each of you are
responsible for 10 assets.

19
00:00:44.705 --> 00:00:46.450
That's a lot of assets!

20
00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.680
Even in this small
business setting,

21
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.000
that's an incredible amount of

22
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.830
things that need protecting.

23
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:54.320
A fundamental truth
of security is you

24
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.860
can only protect the
things you account for.

25
00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.850
Asset management
is the process of

26
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.625
tracking assets and the
risks that affects them.

27
00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:04.790
All security plans revolve
around asset management.

28
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:06.785
Recall that assets include

29
00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:10.210
any item perceived as having
value to an organization.

30
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.520
Equipment, data, and
intellectual property are just a

31
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:14.900
few of the wide range of

32
00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:17.405
assets businesses
want to protect.

33
00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:18.845
A critical part of

34
00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:20.615
every organization's security plan

35
00:01:20.615 --> 00:01:23.035
is keeping track of its assets.

36
00:01:24.035 --> 00:01:26.315
Asset management starts with
having an asset inventory,

37
00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:29.525
a catalog of assets that
need to be protected.

38
00:01:29.525 --> 00:01:31.085
This is a central part

39
00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:33.400
of protecting
organizational assets.

40
00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.765
Without this record,
organizations run

41
00:01:35.765 --> 00:01:38.945
the risk of losing track of
all that's important to them.

42
00:01:38.945 --> 00:01:40.280
A good way to think of

43
00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.525
asset inventories is as a
shepherd protecting sheep.

44
00:01:43.525 --> 00:01:45.860
Having an accurate
count of the number of

45
00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:47.915
sheep help in a lot of ways.

46
00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:50.360
For example, it
will be easier to

47
00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:53.315
allocate resources, like
food, to take care of them.

48
00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:56.059
Another benefit of
asset inventory

49
00:01:56.059 --> 00:01:57.815
might be that you'd get an alert

50
00:01:57.815 --> 00:01:59.585
if one of them goes missing.

51
00:02:00.585 --> 00:02:01.610
Once more, think

52
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:03.715
of the important assets
you have nearby.

53
00:02:03.715 --> 00:02:05.840
Just like me, you're
probably able to

54
00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:08.525
rate them according to
the level of importance.

55
00:02:08.525 --> 00:02:12.035
I would rank my wallet ahead
of my shoes, for example.

56
00:02:12.035 --> 00:02:14.030
In security, this practice is

57
00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.405
known as asset classification.

58
00:02:16.405 --> 00:02:19.190
In general, asset classification

59
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.705
is the practice of labeling

60
00:02:20.705 --> 00:02:22.820
assets based on the sensitivity

61
00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:25.165
and importance to
an organization.

62
00:02:25.165 --> 00:02:27.935
Organizations label
assets differently.

63
00:02:27.935 --> 00:02:31.850
Many of them follow a basic
classification scheme:

64
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.995
public, internal-only,

65
00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:36.325
confidential, and restricted.

66
00:02:37.325 --> 00:02:39.250
Public assets can be
shared with anyone.

67
00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:41.810
Internal-only can be
shared with anyone in

68
00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:44.930
the organization but should
not be shared outside of it.

69
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.940
And confidential assets
should only be

70
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:50.165
accessed by those working
on a specific project.

71
00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:52.970
Assets classified
as restricted are

72
00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:56.555
typically highly sensitive
and must be protected.

73
00:02:56.555 --> 00:02:59.695
Assets with this label are
considered need-to-know.

74
00:02:59.695 --> 00:03:02.120
Examples include
intellectual property

75
00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.220
and health or
payment information.

76
00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.145
For example, a growing
online retailer

77
00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:08.990
might mark internal emails about

78
00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:11.360
a new product as
confidential because those

79
00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.900
working on the new product
should know about it.

80
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:15.560
They might also
label the doors at

81
00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:17.540
their offices with
the restricted sign

82
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.250
to keep everyone out who doesn't

83
00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:21.640
have a specific reason
to be in there.

84
00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:24.500
These are just a couple of
everyday examples that you

85
00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.160
may be familiar with from
your prior experience.

86
00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.930
For the most part, classification
determines whether

87
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:33.380
an asset can be disclosed,
altered, or destroyed.

88
00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:36.335
Asset management is a
continuous process,

89
00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:37.954
one that helps uncover

90
00:03:37.954 --> 00:03:41.260
unexpected gaps in security
for potential risks.

91
00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:43.260
Keeping track of all
that's important to

92
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:47.340
a organization is an essential
part of security planning.
