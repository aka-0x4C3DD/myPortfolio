00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.290
Well done! You made it to
the end of this section!

2
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.850
Being a security practitioner

3
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.670
takes commitment
and a desire to learn.

4
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.370
A big part of the job
involves keeping current with

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.175
best practices and
emerging trends.

6
00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:15.780
Thinking back on my own journey

7
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.145
into the world of security,

8
00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:19.875
I'm so proud of you for
your continued commitment.

9
00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.155
We've covered a lot of
material this week, and

10
00:00:22.155 --> 00:00:24.420
this is a good time to
reflect and look back

11
00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:26.925
on the key concepts
we explored together.

12
00:00:27.925 --> 00:00:28.635
We covered the
building blocks of

13
00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:30.390
organizational risk management:

14
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.015
assets, threats, and
vulnerabilities.

15
00:00:34.015 --> 00:00:35.400
We also spent some
time demonstrating

16
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.070
the importance of
asset inventories.

17
00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.590
It's much easier to protect
company assets if

18
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.605
you know where they are and
who's responsible for them.

19
00:00:44.605 --> 00:00:46.200
After that, we
moved on to explore

20
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.035
the challenges in a rapidly
changing digital world.

21
00:00:49.035 --> 00:00:51.090
Part of protecting
data in this world

22
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.220
is understanding if it's in use,

23
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:55.245
in transit, or at rest.

24
00:00:56.245 --> 00:00:58.050
Finally, in our
high-level exploration

25
00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.190
of policies, standards,

26
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:01.110
and procedures, we talked about

27
00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:04.380
how each of them factor into
achieving security goals.

28
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:05.925
There's no one-size-fits-all

29
00:01:05.925 --> 00:01:08.100
approach to
achieving security.

30
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.860
While exploring the NIST
Cybersecurity Framework,

31
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.720
you gained an
appreciation of how it

32
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.180
supports good
security practices.

33
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.210
Attackers are also constantly
building their skills

34
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:19.590
and finding new ways to break

35
00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.195
through the defenses we put up.

36
00:01:21.195 --> 00:01:24.570
Remember, the landscape
is always changing.

37
00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:26.550
There's always more
to learn if you want

38
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.650
to be a good security
practitioner.

39
00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.510
Next up, we're going to expand

40
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.790
our security mindset
by learning more about

41
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:34.920
the different systems
security teams use

42
00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:37.590
to protect
organizational assets.

43
00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:40.030
I'm looking forward to it!
