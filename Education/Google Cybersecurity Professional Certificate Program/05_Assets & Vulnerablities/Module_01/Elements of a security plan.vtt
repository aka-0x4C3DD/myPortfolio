00:00:00.851 --> 00:00:04.843
Security is all about people,
processes, and technology.

2
00:00:04.843 --> 00:00:07.877
It's a team effort, and
I mean that literally.

3
00:00:07.877 --> 00:00:11.418
Protecting assets extends
well beyond one person or

4
00:00:11.418 --> 00:00:13.997
a group of people in an IT department.

5
00:00:13.997 --> 00:00:17.120
The truth of the matter is
that security is a culture.

6
00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.919
It's a shared set of values that
spans all levels of an organization.

7
00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:26.363
These values touch everyone, from
employees, to vendors, to customers.

8
00:00:26.363 --> 00:00:31.024
Protecting digital and physical assets
requires everyone to participate,

9
00:00:31.024 --> 00:00:32.567
which can be a challenge.

10
00:00:33.567 --> 00:00:34.923
That's what security plans are for!

11
00:00:34.923 --> 00:00:39.582
Plans come in many shapes and sizes, but
they all share a common goal:

12
00:00:39.582 --> 00:00:42.463
to be prepared for risks when they happen.

13
00:00:42.463 --> 00:00:47.464
Placing the focus on people is what leads
to the most effective security plans.

14
00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:51.895
Considering the diverse backgrounds and
perspectives of everyone involved

15
00:00:51.895 --> 00:00:55.081
ensures that no one is left out
when something goes wrong.

16
00:00:55.081 --> 00:00:59.165
We talked earlier about the risk
as being anything that can impact

17
00:00:59.165 --> 00:01:03.336
the confidentiality, integrity,
or availability of an asset.

18
00:01:03.336 --> 00:01:06.629
Most security plans address
risks by breaking them down

19
00:01:06.629 --> 00:01:08.949
according to categories and factors.

20
00:01:09.949 --> 00:01:12.542
Some common risk categories might include,
the damage,

21
00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:14.971
disclosure, or loss of information.

22
00:01:14.971 --> 00:01:18.721
Any of these can be due to factors
like the physical damage or

23
00:01:18.721 --> 00:01:20.455
malfunctions of a device.

24
00:01:20.455 --> 00:01:23.727
There are also factors like attacks and
human error.

25
00:01:23.727 --> 00:01:27.825
For example, a new school teacher may be
asked to sign a contract before their

26
00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:28.906
first day of class.

27
00:01:28.906 --> 00:01:32.891
The agreement may warn against some
common risks associated with human error,

28
00:01:32.891 --> 00:01:35.937
like using a personal email to
send sensitive information.

29
00:01:35.937 --> 00:01:40.003
A security plan may require that all
new hires sign off on this agreement,

30
00:01:40.003 --> 00:01:44.292
effectively spreading the values
that ensure everyone's in alignment.

31
00:01:44.292 --> 00:01:49.143
This is just one example of the types and
causes of risk that a plan might address.

32
00:01:49.143 --> 00:01:52.291
These things vary widely
depending on the company.

33
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:56.129
But how these plans are communicated
is similar across industries.

34
00:01:57.129 --> 00:02:00.236
Security plans consist of three
basic elements: policies, standards,

35
00:02:00.236 --> 00:02:01.252
and procedures.

36
00:02:01.252 --> 00:02:04.612
These three elements are how
companies share their security plans.

37
00:02:04.612 --> 00:02:08.043
These words tend to be used
interchangeably outside of security, but

38
00:02:08.043 --> 00:02:11.535
you'll soon discover that they each
have a very specific meaning and

39
00:02:11.535 --> 00:02:12.931
function in this context.

40
00:02:13.931 --> 00:02:18.289
A policy in security is a set of rules
that reduce risk and protects information.

41
00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:21.756
Policies are the foundation
of every security plan.

42
00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:25.926
They give everyone in and out of
an organization guidance by addressing

43
00:02:25.926 --> 00:02:28.855
questions like,
what are we protecting and why?

44
00:02:28.855 --> 00:02:33.422
Policies focus on the strategic side
of things by identifying the scope,

45
00:02:33.422 --> 00:02:36.601
objectives, and
limitations of a security plan.

46
00:02:36.601 --> 00:02:40.772
For instance,
newly hired employees at many companies

47
00:02:40.772 --> 00:02:45.040
are required to sign off on
acceptable use policy, or AUP.

48
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.264
These provisions outline secure ways
that an employee may access corporate systems.

49
00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:52.476
Standards are the next part.

50
00:02:52.476 --> 00:02:57.662
These have a tactical function, as they
concern how well we're protecting assets.

51
00:02:57.662 --> 00:03:02.737
In security, standards are references
that inform how to set policies.

52
00:03:02.737 --> 00:03:06.900
A good way to think of standards is
that they create a point of reference.

53
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.981
For example, many companies use the
password management standard identified

54
00:03:11.981 --> 00:03:17.062
in NIST Special Publication 800-63B
to improve their security policies

55
00:03:17.062 --> 00:03:22.392
by specifying that employees' passwords
must be at least eight characters long.

56
00:03:23.392 --> 00:03:25.346
The last part of a plan is its procedures.

57
00:03:25.346 --> 00:03:30.503
Procedures are step-by-step instructions
to perform a specific security task.

58
00:03:30.503 --> 00:03:34.542
Organizations usually keep multiple
procedure documents that are used

59
00:03:34.542 --> 00:03:38.788
throughout the company, like how
employees can choose secure passwords,

60
00:03:38.788 --> 00:03:43.037
or how they can securely reset
a password if it's been locked.

61
00:03:43.037 --> 00:03:48.048
Sharing clear and actionable procedures
with everyone creates accountability,

62
00:03:48.048 --> 00:03:51.493
consistency, and
efficiency across an organization.

63
00:03:52.493 --> 00:03:55.711
Policies, standards, and
procedures vary widely from one company to

64
00:03:55.711 --> 00:03:59.732
another because they are tailored
to each organization's goals.

65
00:03:59.732 --> 00:04:04.395
Simply understanding the structure
of security plans is a great start.

66
00:04:04.395 --> 00:04:08.798
For now, I hope you have a clearer
picture of what policies, standards, and

67
00:04:08.798 --> 00:04:13.153
procedures are, and how they are essential
to making security a team effort.
