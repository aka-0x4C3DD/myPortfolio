00:00:04.671 --> 00:00:07.841
I'm Tri, a security engineer at Google.

2
00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:10.969
My department is Detection and Response.

3
00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:12.929
Let's see,
what does my everyday look like?

4
00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:17.058
Well, of course I have the free lunch
and coffee, which is nice.

5
00:00:17.058 --> 00:00:20.353
And then I finally get to my desk
and I open up the SIEM to see

6
00:00:20.353 --> 00:00:23.314
what kind of exciting events
are there for me to look into

7
00:00:23.314 --> 00:00:26.443
and what threats there could be out there
for me to analyze.

8
00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:32.323
Also, I work on improving our analysis
for detection of potential threats.

9
00:00:32.323 --> 00:00:35.618
So my security passion
developed at a young age.

10
00:00:35.618 --> 00:00:39.080
I was a victim of a hack,
believe it or not.

11
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:43.001
After school every day at that time
I would go home and play a computer game.

12
00:00:43.001 --> 00:00:48.715
One day I got home, I brought it up
and it said, "Your CD key is in use by...",

13
00:00:48.715 --> 00:00:52.385
and then it gave some strange name there
that I didn't recognize.

14
00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:54.345
At first I felt shocked.

15
00:00:54.345 --> 00:00:58.558
I had bought this game myself
and somebody stole my CD key,

16
00:00:58.558 --> 00:01:02.937
but it did provide me this motivation
to start to learn how to defend myself.

17
00:01:02.937 --> 00:01:07.150
For example,
I learned about manual removal of malware,

18
00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.943
and that became one of my favorite topics.

19
00:01:08.943 --> 00:01:12.447
Also, for fun,
I started doing some white hat hacker

20
00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:15.909
activity against some of my friends.

21
00:01:15.909 --> 00:01:17.952
Asset security is a very important field,

22
00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:23.917
and there's many varieties of assets
that you could be looking into to protect.

23
00:01:23.917 --> 00:01:28.129
My favorite part is building
the detections

24
00:01:28.129 --> 00:01:32.634
that actually have the potential
to catch malicious behavior.

25
00:01:32.634 --> 00:01:36.012
In asset management security,
you have the ability

26
00:01:36.012 --> 00:01:38.932
to accurately inventory

27
00:01:38.932 --> 00:01:44.104
all of the assets
which include IP, user data,

28
00:01:44.104 --> 00:01:49.651
employee machines,
and to make sure you have

29
00:01:49.651 --> 00:01:53.404
a security posture
that's on par with what you need.

30
00:01:53.404 --> 00:01:57.408
There's always new technology
coming on the scene, new hardware,

31
00:01:57.408 --> 00:02:03.373
and we are responsible for understanding
what potential new threats are out there.

32
00:02:03.373 --> 00:02:06.459
Problem
solving ability and creative thinking

33
00:02:06.459 --> 00:02:10.004
is important in cybersecurity
because there's always complex problems,

34
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:14.217
and people need to be able to think
outside of the box, think creatively,

35
00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:17.011
and think holistically as they approach

36
00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:20.181
their solutions to mitigate risks.

37
00:02:20.181 --> 00:02:23.476
Cybersecurity is a noble occupation.

38
00:02:23.476 --> 00:02:25.270
Many things can happen.

39
00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.356
Many bad
things can happen on the Internet,

40
00:02:28.356 --> 00:02:32.402
but we can be there to stand up against it

41
00:02:32.402 --> 00:02:34.320
and we can be there
to do something about it.

42
00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:38.908
We can be there to protect our users,
or family members, or friends.

43
00:02:38.908 --> 00:02:41.536
That responsibility is heavy.

44
00:02:41.536 --> 00:02:45.081
But also, of course, it's
a very important mission.

45
00:02:45.081 --> 00:02:47.667
And I am proud to
be within the security team.
