00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.691
Painting a portrait.
Perfecting a new basketball move.

2
00:00:03.691 --> 00:00:07.700
Playing a solo on guitar.
They all share something in common.

3
00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.961
Can you guess what it is?

4
00:00:09.961 --> 00:00:13.107
If you thought "practice,"
you're absolutely correct!

5
00:00:13.107 --> 00:00:17.112
It takes time, dedication, and
focus to improve these skills.

6
00:00:17.112 --> 00:00:19.084
The security profession is no different.

7
00:00:19.084 --> 00:00:19.807
Planning for

8
00:00:19.807 --> 00:00:24.280
the future is a core skill that you'll
need to practice all the time in security.

9
00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:28.412
We all deal with uncertainty by trying
to solve problems before they arise.

10
00:00:28.412 --> 00:00:30.592
For example, if you're going on a trip,

11
00:00:30.592 --> 00:00:33.972
you might think about the length
of the trip and how much to pack.

12
00:00:33.972 --> 00:00:37.366
Maybe you're traveling somewhere cold.
You might bring coats and

13
00:00:37.366 --> 00:00:38.981
sweaters to help keep you warm.

14
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:43.013
We all want to feel the security of
knowing that there's a plan if something

15
00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:43.719
goes wrong.

16
00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:46.507
Businesses are no different.
Just like you,

17
00:00:46.507 --> 00:00:50.303
organizations try their best to
plan ahead by analyzing risk.

18
00:00:51.303 --> 00:00:54.374
Security teams help companies
by focusing on risk.

19
00:00:54.374 --> 00:00:59.177
In security, a risk is anything that
can impact the confidentiality,

20
00:00:59.177 --> 00:01:02.066
integrity, or availability of an asset.

21
00:01:02.066 --> 00:01:05.522
Our primary focus as security
practitioners is to maintain

22
00:01:05.522 --> 00:01:08.633
confidentiality, integrity,
and availability,

23
00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:11.479
which are the three
components of the CIA triad.

24
00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.566
The process of security risk planning is
the first step toward protecting these

25
00:01:15.566 --> 00:01:16.421
cornerstones.

26
00:01:16.421 --> 00:01:21.287
Each organization has their own unique
security plan based on the risk they face.

27
00:01:21.287 --> 00:01:25.661
Thankfully, you don't need to be familiar
with every possible security plan to be

28
00:01:25.661 --> 00:01:27.356
a good security practitioner.

29
00:01:27.356 --> 00:01:31.952
All you really need to know are the basics
of how these plans are put together.

30
00:01:32.952 --> 00:01:36.499
Security plans are based on
the analysis of three elements: assets,

31
00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:38.744
threats, and vulnerabilities.

32
00:01:38.744 --> 00:01:43.284
Organizations measure security risk by
analyzing how each can have an effect on

33
00:01:43.284 --> 00:01:47.621
confidentiality, integrity, and
availability of their information and

34
00:01:47.621 --> 00:01:48.244
systems.

35
00:01:48.244 --> 00:01:52.063
Basically, they each represent the what,
why, and how of security.

36
00:01:52.063 --> 00:01:55.956
Let's spend a little time exploring
each of these in more detail.

37
00:01:56.956 --> 00:02:00.301
As you might imagine, an asset is
an item perceived as having value to

38
00:02:00.301 --> 00:02:01.549
an organization.

39
00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:06.844
This often includes a wide range of
things. Buildings, equipment, data,

40
00:02:06.844 --> 00:02:11.741
and people are all examples of assets
that businesses want to protect.

41
00:02:11.741 --> 00:02:16.315
Let's examine this idea more by
analyzing the assets of a home.

42
00:02:16.315 --> 00:02:19.491
Inside a home, there's a wide
range of assets, like people and

43
00:02:19.491 --> 00:02:20.721
personal belongings.

44
00:02:20.721 --> 00:02:25.308
The outside structure of a home is made
of assets too, like the walls, roof,

45
00:02:25.308 --> 00:02:26.660
windows, and doors.

46
00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:30.640
All of these assets have value, but they
differ in how they might be protected.

47
00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.418
Someone might place a lower priority
on protecting the outside walls than on

48
00:02:34.418 --> 00:02:35.962
the front door, for example.

49
00:02:35.962 --> 00:02:40.032
This is because a burglar is more likely
to enter through the front door than

50
00:02:40.032 --> 00:02:41.983
a wall. That's why we have locks.

51
00:02:41.983 --> 00:02:44.779
With so many types of assets to think of,

52
00:02:44.779 --> 00:02:48.084
security plans need to
prioritize resources.

53
00:02:48.084 --> 00:02:51.426
After all,
no matter how large a security team is,

54
00:02:51.426 --> 00:02:56.420
it would be impossible to monitor every
single asset at all hours of the day.

55
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.782
Security teams can prioritize
their efforts based on threats.

56
00:03:00.782 --> 00:03:03.619
In security,
a threat is any circumstance or

57
00:03:03.619 --> 00:03:06.318
event that can negatively impact assets.

58
00:03:06.318 --> 00:03:10.985
Much like assets,
threats include a wide range of things.

59
00:03:10.985 --> 00:03:13.370
Going back to the example of a home,

60
00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:17.039
a threat can be a burglar
who's trying to gain access.

61
00:03:17.039 --> 00:03:20.964
Burglars aren't the only type of threat
that affect the security of windows

62
00:03:20.964 --> 00:03:21.587
and doors.

63
00:03:21.587 --> 00:03:23.026
What if either broke by accident?

64
00:03:23.026 --> 00:03:26.540
Strong winds can blow the door
open during a bad storm.

65
00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:30.309
Or, kids playing with a ball nearby
can accidentally damage a window.

66
00:03:30.309 --> 00:03:33.684
If any of these thoughts crossed your mind,
great job!

67
00:03:33.684 --> 00:03:37.070
You're already demonstrating
a security mindset.

68
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.609
The final element of a security plan that
we're going to cover are vulnerabilities.

69
00:03:41.609 --> 00:03:46.299
In security, a vulnerability is a weakness
that can be exploited by a threat.

70
00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:48.749
A weak lock on a front door, for example,

71
00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.969
is a vulnerability that can
be exploited by a burglar.

72
00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:56.668
And old, cracked wood is a different
vulnerability on that same front door that

73
00:03:56.668 --> 00:03:59.283
can increase the chances of storm damage.

74
00:03:59.283 --> 00:04:03.426
In other words, think of vulnerabilities
as flaws within an asset.

75
00:04:03.426 --> 00:04:08.024
Assets can have many different types of
vulnerabilities that are an easy target

76
00:04:08.024 --> 00:04:08.994
for attackers.

77
00:04:09.994 --> 00:04:11.234
We'll explore different
types of threats and

78
00:04:11.234 --> 00:04:13.364
vulnerabilities in greater detail later.

79
00:04:13.364 --> 00:04:17.817
For now, just understand that security
teams need to account for a wide range of

80
00:04:17.817 --> 00:04:22.219
assets, threats, and vulnerabilities
to effectively plan for the future.
