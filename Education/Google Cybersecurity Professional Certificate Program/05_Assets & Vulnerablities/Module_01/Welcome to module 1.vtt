00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:03.887
We all depend on technology so
much nowadays.

2
00:00:03.887 --> 00:00:06.127
Examples of this are all around us.

3
00:00:06.127 --> 00:00:10.263
Personal devices, like smartphones, help
keep us in touch with friends and

4
00:00:10.263 --> 00:00:11.900
families across the globe.

5
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.329
Wearable technologies help us achieve
personal goals and be more productive.

6
00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:20.071
Businesses have also come to embrace
technology in everyday life.

7
00:00:20.071 --> 00:00:24.477
From streamlining operations to
automating processes, our world is more

8
00:00:24.477 --> 00:00:26.652
connected because of technology.

9
00:00:27.652 --> 00:00:30.614
The more we rely on technology,
the more information we share.

10
00:00:30.614 --> 00:00:34.650
As a result, an enormous amount
of data is created every day.

11
00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:38.524
This huge surge in
data creation presents unique challenges.

12
00:00:38.524 --> 00:00:41.305
As businesses become more
reliant on technology,

13
00:00:41.305 --> 00:00:45.660
cybercriminals become more sophisticated
in how they affect organizations.

14
00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.292
Data breaches are becoming increasingly
serious due to all the sensitive data

15
00:00:50.292 --> 00:00:51.844
businesses are storing.

16
00:00:51.844 --> 00:00:57.304
One positive aspect of these challenges is
a growing need for individuals like you!

17
00:00:57.304 --> 00:00:59.125
Security is a team effort.

18
00:00:59.125 --> 00:01:03.610
Unique perspectives, like yours,
are an asset to any organization.

19
00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.080
A team filled with diverse backgrounds,
cultures, and

20
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:11.069
experiences is more likely to
solve problems and be innovative.

21
00:01:11.069 --> 00:01:14.998
As breach after breach hits the
headlines, it's clear that organizations

22
00:01:14.998 --> 00:01:17.930
need more professionals focused on security.

23
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.647
Companies around the globe are working
hard to keep up with the demands

24
00:01:21.647 --> 00:01:23.925
of a rapidly changing digital landscape.

25
00:01:23.925 --> 00:01:29.769
As the environment continues to transform,
the more your personal experience is valuable.

26
00:01:30.769 --> 00:01:33.501
In this section, we'll start by
exploring how assets, threats,

27
00:01:33.501 --> 00:01:36.325
and vulnerabilities factor
into security plans.

28
00:01:36.325 --> 00:01:39.795
After that, we'll discuss
the use of asset inventories in

29
00:01:39.795 --> 00:01:43.260
protecting the wide range of
assets that companies have.

30
00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.856
Then, we'll consider the challenges in
this rapidly changing digital world.

31
00:01:47.856 --> 00:01:52.900
And finally, you'll gain an understanding
of the building blocks of a security plan:

32
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:55.850
its policies, standards, and procedures.

33
00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.787
We'll examine the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework that companies use to

34
00:01:59.787 --> 00:02:03.798
create security plans that protect
their customers and their brands.

35
00:02:03.798 --> 00:02:07.175
I hope you're as excited to go on
this journey into this world of security

36
00:02:07.175 --> 00:02:08.175
as I am.

37
00:02:08.175 --> 00:02:09.697
Now, let's get started!
