00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.172
Having a plan is just one
part of securing assets.

2
00:00:04.172 --> 00:00:08.883
Once the plan is in action, the other
part is making sure everyone's following along.

3
00:00:08.883 --> 00:00:11.643
In security, we call this compliance.

4
00:00:12.643 --> 00:00:15.732
Compliance is the process of
adhering to internal standards and

5
00:00:15.732 --> 00:00:17.332
external regulations.

6
00:00:17.332 --> 00:00:21.973
Small companies and large organizations
around the world place security compliance

7
00:00:21.973 --> 00:00:24.110
at the top of their list of priorities.

8
00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.034
At a high-level, maintaining trust,
reputation, safety, and

9
00:00:28.034 --> 00:00:33.229
the integrity of your data are just a few
reasons to be concerned about compliance.

10
00:00:33.229 --> 00:00:37.186
Fines, penalties, and
lawsuits are other reasons.

11
00:00:37.186 --> 00:00:38.930
This is particularly true for

12
00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.830
companies in highly regulated industries,
like health care, energy, and finance.

13
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.538
Being out of compliance with
a regulation can cause long lasting

14
00:00:47.538 --> 00:00:51.919
financial and reputational effects that
can seriously impact a business.

15
00:00:52.919 --> 00:00:54.422
Regulations are rules
set by a government or

16
00:00:54.422 --> 00:00:57.550
other authority to control
the way something is done.

17
00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.271
Like policies,
regulations exist to protect people and

18
00:01:01.271 --> 00:01:04.146
their information, but on a larger scale.

19
00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:08.343
Compliance can be a complex process
because of the many regulations that

20
00:01:08.343 --> 00:01:10.004
exist all around the world.

21
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:14.769
For our purpose, we're going to focus
on a framework of security compliance,

22
00:01:14.769 --> 00:01:17.530
the U.S. based NIST Cybersecurity Framework.

23
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:21.346
Earlier in the program, you learned
the National Institute of Standards and

24
00:01:21.346 --> 00:01:22.730
Technology, or NIST.

25
00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:27.097
One of the primary roles of NIST is to
openly provide companies with a set of

26
00:01:27.097 --> 00:01:32.630
frameworks and security standards that
reflect key security related regulations.

27
00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.991
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework
is a voluntary framework that consists of

28
00:01:36.991 --> 00:01:39.736
standards, guidelines, and best practices

29
00:01:39.736 --> 00:01:44.860
to manage cybersecurity risk.
Commonly known as the CSF,

30
00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:49.284
this framework was developed to help
businesses secure one of their most important

31
00:01:49.284 --> 00:01:51.630
assets, information.

32
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:58.010
The CSF consists of three main components:
the core, it's tiers, and it's profiles.

33
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.001
Let's explore each of these together

34
00:02:01.001 --> 00:02:05.420
to build a better understanding
of how NIST's CSF is used.

35
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.438
The core is basically a simplified
version of the functions, or

36
00:02:09.438 --> 00:02:11.222
duties, of a security plan.

37
00:02:11.222 --> 00:02:15.438
The CSF core identifies five
broad functions:

38
00:02:15.438 --> 00:02:19.000
identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover.

39
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.958
Think of these categories of
the core as a security checklist.

40
00:02:23.958 --> 00:02:28.120
After the core, the next NIST
component we'll discuss is its tiers.

41
00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:30.808
These provide security
teams with a way to measure

42
00:02:30.808 --> 00:02:34.020
performance across each of
the five functions of the core.

43
00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.700
Tiers range from Level-1 to Level-4.

44
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.480
Level-1, or passive, indicates a function
is reaching bare minimum standards.

45
00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:44.237
Level-4, or

46
00:02:44.237 --> 00:02:50.308
adaptive, is an indication that a function
is being performed at an exemplary standard.

47
00:02:50.308 --> 00:02:55.040
You may have noticed that CSF tiers
aren't a yes or no proposition;

48
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.787
instead, there's a range of values.

49
00:02:57.787 --> 00:03:02.195
That's because tiers are designed as
a way of showing organizations what is and

50
00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:05.130
isn't working with their security plans.

51
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:08.684
Lastly, profiles are the final
component of CSF.

52
00:03:08.684 --> 00:03:13.500
These provide insight into
the current state of a security plan.

53
00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:17.632
One way to think of profiles is like
photos capturing a moment in time.

54
00:03:17.632 --> 00:03:20.925
Comparing photos of the same
subject taken at different times

55
00:03:20.925 --> 00:03:23.260
can provide useful insights.

56
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.856
For example, without these photos, you
might not notice how this tree has changed.

57
00:03:27.856 --> 00:03:31.040
It's the same
with NIST profiles.

58
00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:34.289
Good security practice is about
more than avoiding fines and attacks.

59
00:03:34.289 --> 00:03:38.510
It demonstrates that you care
about people and their information.

60
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.937
Before we go, let's visit the core's
functions one more time to look at where

61
00:03:42.937 --> 00:03:45.070
we've been and where we're going.

62
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.704
The first function is identify.
Our previous discussions on asset

63
00:03:49.704 --> 00:03:53.779
management and
risk assessment relates to that function.

64
00:03:53.779 --> 00:03:58.600
Coming up, we're going to focus on many
of the categories of the second function,

65
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.416
the protect function.
Meet you there!
