00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:05.330
For every asset that needs protecting,
there are dozens of vulnerabilities.

2
00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:07.370
Finding those vulnerabilities and

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.530
fixing them before they become a problem
is the key to keep an asset safe.

4
00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:14.863
We've already covered what
a vulnerability is.

5
00:00:14.863 --> 00:00:19.270
Recall that a vulnerability is a weakness
that can be exploited by a threat.

6
00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.520
That word, can,
is an important part of this description.

7
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:24.230
Why is that?

8
00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.700
Let's explore that
together to find out more.

9
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.780
Imagine I handed you an important
document and asked you to keep it safe.

10
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.610
How would you do that?

11
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.659
Some of you might first think about
locking it up in a safe place.

12
00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:42.319
Behind this is the understanding that,
because documents can be easily moved,

13
00:00:42.319 --> 00:00:44.161
they are vulnerable to theft.

14
00:00:44.161 --> 00:00:48.373
When other vulnerabilities come to mind,
like how paper burns easily or

15
00:00:48.373 --> 00:00:51.839
doesn't resist water,
you might add other protections.

16
00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.922
Similar to this example,
security teams plan to protect

17
00:00:54.922 --> 00:00:59.300
assets according to their vulnerabilities
and how they can be exploited.

18
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.640
In security, an exploit is a way of taking
advantage of a vulnerability.

19
00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.712
Besides finding vulnerabilities,
security planning relies a lot on thinking of exploits.

20
00:01:09.712 --> 00:01:13.880
For example, there are
burglars out there who want to cause harm.

21
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.202
Homes have vulnerable systems that
can be exploited by a burglar. An

22
00:01:18.202 --> 00:01:22.180
example are the windows.
Glass is vulnerable to being broken.

23
00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.500
A burglar can exploit this vulnerability
by using a rock to break the window.

24
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.574
Thinking of this vulnerability and exploit
ahead of time allows us to plan ahead.

25
00:01:32.574 --> 00:01:37.490
We can have an alarm system in place to scare
the burglar away and alert the police.

26
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.313
Security teams spend a lot of
time finding vulnerabilities and

27
00:01:41.313 --> 00:01:44.060
thinking of how they can be exploited.

28
00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.053
They do this with the process
known as vulnerability management.

29
00:01:48.053 --> 00:01:53.083
Vulnerability management is the process
of finding and patching vulnerabilities.

30
00:01:53.083 --> 00:01:56.337
Vulnerability management
helps keep assets safe.

31
00:01:56.337 --> 00:02:00.544
It's a method of stopping threats
before they can become a problem.

32
00:02:00.544 --> 00:02:03.640
Vulnerability management
is a four step process.

33
00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:06.576
The first step is to
identify vulnerabilities.

34
00:02:06.576 --> 00:02:11.180
The next step is to consider potential
exploits of those vulnerabilities.

35
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.583
Third is to prepare defenses
against threats. And finally,

36
00:02:15.583 --> 00:02:19.770
the fourth step is to
evaluate those defenses.

37
00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:23.469
When the last step ends,
the process starts again.

38
00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.044
Vulnerability management
happens in a cycle.

39
00:02:26.044 --> 00:02:28.616
It's a regular part of
what security teams do

40
00:02:28.616 --> 00:02:32.432
because there are always new
vulnerabilities to be concerned about.

41
00:02:33.432 --> 00:02:36.168
This is exactly why a diverse
set of perspectives is useful!

42
00:02:36.168 --> 00:02:38.512
Having a wide range of backgrounds and

43
00:02:38.512 --> 00:02:43.590
experiences only strengthens security
teams and their ability to find exploits.

44
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:49.330
However, even large and diverse security
teams can't keep track of everything.

45
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.483
New vulnerabilities
are constantly being discovered.

46
00:02:52.483 --> 00:02:54.730
These are known as zero-day exploits.

47
00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:58.540
A zero-day is an exploit
that was previously unknown.

48
00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:03.445
The term zero-day refers to the fact that
the exploit is happening in real time

49
00:03:03.445 --> 00:03:05.410
with zero days to fix it.

50
00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:07.611
These kind of exploits are dangerous.

51
00:03:07.611 --> 00:03:11.000
They represent threats that
haven't been planned for yet.

52
00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.760
For example, we can anticipate the possibility of
a burglar breaking into our home.

53
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:19.187
We can plan for this type of threat
by having defenses in place,

54
00:03:19.187 --> 00:03:21.210
like locks on the doors and windows.

55
00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:24.737
A zero-day exploit would be
something totally unexpected,

56
00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:28.470
like the lock on the door
falling off from intense heat.

57
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:31.890
Zero-day exploits are things that
don't normally come to mind.

58
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:37.140
For example, this might be a new form
of spyware infecting a popular website.

59
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.002
When zero-day exploits happen,

60
00:03:39.002 --> 00:03:42.927
they can leave assets even more
vulnerable to threats than they already are.

61
00:03:43.927 --> 00:03:47.626
Vulnerability management is the process of
finding vulnerabilities and fixing their exploits.

62
00:03:47.626 --> 00:03:52.215
That's why the process is
performed regularly at most organizations.

63
00:03:52.215 --> 00:03:56.625
Perhaps the most important step of the
process is identifying vulnerabilities.

64
00:03:56.625 --> 00:04:00.444
We'll explore this step in more
details next time we get together.

65
00:04:00.444 --> 00:04:01.991
I'll meet you again then!
