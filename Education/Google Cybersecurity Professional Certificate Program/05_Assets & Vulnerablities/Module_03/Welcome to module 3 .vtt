00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.539
Wow! We've covered a lot together!

2
00:00:03.539 --> 00:00:07.210
It's hard to believe we've reached
the midpoint of this course.

3
00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:10.497
I hope you're getting a clearer
picture of this exciting field and

4
00:00:10.497 --> 00:00:12.446
all the opportunities it has to offer.

5
00:00:12.446 --> 00:00:15.834
And most importantly,
I hope you're having fun doing it.

6
00:00:16.834 --> 00:00:18.562
We've come a long ways
from where we started.

7
00:00:18.562 --> 00:00:22.725
When we began our journey together,
we were introduced to the three building

8
00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:27.028
blocks of every security program:
assets, threats, and vulnerabilities.

9
00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:29.663
We focused a lot on assets early on

10
00:00:29.663 --> 00:00:34.425
and the wide range of things security
professionals work to protect.

11
00:00:35.425 --> 00:00:38.087
We then turned our attention to
a core component of asset security,

12
00:00:38.087 --> 00:00:39.250
protecting assets.

13
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:42.731
You learned about the importance
of guarding sensitive information.

14
00:00:42.731 --> 00:00:47.479
You also learned about some security
controls that protect information from

15
00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:48.874
being lost or stolen.

16
00:00:49.874 --> 00:00:50.458
On the next part of our journey,

17
00:00:50.458 --> 00:00:53.048
we're going to turn our
focus to vulnerabilities.

18
00:00:53.048 --> 00:00:56.823
Every asset we protect has
a series of vulnerabilities, or flaws,

19
00:00:56.823 --> 00:00:59.034
that we need to be aware of.

20
00:00:59.034 --> 00:01:02.762
Staying informed of these things is
a critical part of protecting people and

21
00:01:02.762 --> 00:01:04.110
organizations from harm.

22
00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:05.952
In this next part of the course,

23
00:01:05.952 --> 00:01:10.264
you'll gain an understanding of
the vulnerability management process.

24
00:01:10.264 --> 00:01:13.699
First, you'll explore a common approach
to vulnerability management:

25
00:01:13.699 --> 00:01:15.383
the defense and depth model.

26
00:01:15.383 --> 00:01:19.314
Then, you will learn about how
vulnerabilities are documented in

27
00:01:19.314 --> 00:01:21.582
online libraries like the CVE list.

28
00:01:21.582 --> 00:01:25.975
We'll discuss the attack surfaces
security teams protect.

29
00:01:25.975 --> 00:01:30.711
And lastly, you'll expand your attacker
mindset by exploring the common attack

30
00:01:30.711 --> 00:01:33.123
vectors cybercriminals try to exploit.

31
00:01:34.123 --> 00:01:36.627
Security analysts play an important
role in identifying and

32
00:01:36.627 --> 00:01:39.175
correcting vulnerabilities in systems.

33
00:01:39.175 --> 00:01:41.432
I know I'm excited to keep exploring,

34
00:01:41.432 --> 00:01:42.464
are you?

35
00:01:42.464 --> 00:01:43.194
Then let's go!
