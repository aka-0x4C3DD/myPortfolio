1
00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:05.130
We've discussed before that
security is a team effort.

2
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.320
Did you know the group extends

3
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.900
well beyond a single
security team?

4
00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.230
Protecting information
is a global effort!

5
00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:15.030
When it comes to
vulnerabilities,

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.910
there are actually
online public libraries.

7
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.790
Individuals and
organizations use them to

8
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:24.300
share and document common
vulnerabilities and exposures.

9
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.940
We've been focusing a
lot on vulnerabilities.

10
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.510
Exposures are similar, but
they have a key difference.

11
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.360
While a vulnerability is
a weakness of a system,

12
00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.190
an exposure is a mistake

13
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.570
that can be exploited
by a threat.

14
00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:39.870
For example, imagine you're

15
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.450
asked to protect an
important document.

16
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.735
Documents are vulnerable
to being misplaced.

17
00:00:45.735 --> 00:00:48.785
If you laid the document
down near an open window,

18
00:00:48.785 --> 00:00:51.440
it could be exposed
to being blown away.

19
00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:53.600
One of the most
popular libraries of

20
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.050
vulnerabilities and
exposures is the CVE list.

21
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.770
The common vulnerabilities and

22
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.430
exposures list, or CVE list,

23
00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:03.725
is an openly
accessible dictionary

24
00:01:03.725 --> 00:01:06.155
of known vulnerabilities
and exposures.

25
00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:08.320
It is a popular resource.

26
00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.135
Many organizations
use a CVE list

27
00:01:11.135 --> 00:01:13.790
to find ways to improve
their defenses.

28
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.340
The CVE list was
originally created

29
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.990
by MITRE corporation in 1999.

30
00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.750
MITRE is a collection of

31
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.695
non-profit research and
development centers.

32
00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:26.065
They're sponsored by
the US government.

33
00:01:26.065 --> 00:01:27.770
Their focus is on improving

34
00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:30.125
security technologies
around the world.

35
00:01:31.125 --> 00:01:32.750
The main purpose of
the CVE list is to

36
00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.090
offer a standard
way of identifying

37
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.725
and categorizing known
vulnerabilities and exposures.

38
00:01:38.725 --> 00:01:40.850
Most CVEs in the list are

39
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:43.205
reported by independent
researchers,

40
00:01:43.205 --> 00:01:45.995
technology vendors,
and ethical hackers,

41
00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:48.125
but anyone can report one.

42
00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:52.015
Before a CVE can make
it onto the CVE list,

43
00:01:52.015 --> 00:01:55.365
it first goes through a
strict review process by

44
00:01:55.365 --> 00:01:59.190
a CVE Numbering
Authority, or CNA.

45
00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.630
A CNA is an organization
that volunteers to

46
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:06.835
analyze and distribute
information on eligible CVEs.

47
00:02:06.835 --> 00:02:08.480
All of these groups have

48
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:11.270
an established record of
researching vulnerabilities

49
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.530
and demonstrating security
advisory capabilities.

50
00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:17.540
When a vulnerability or
exposure is reported to them,

51
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.465
a rigorous testing
process takes place.

52
00:02:21.465 --> 00:02:23.540
The CVE list tests
four criteria that

53
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:26.755
a vulnerability must have
before it's assigned an ID.

54
00:02:26.755 --> 00:02:30.340
First, it must be
independent of other issues.

55
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.170
In other words, the
vulnerability should be able to

56
00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.215
be fixed without having
to fix something else.

57
00:02:36.215 --> 00:02:38.900
Second, it must be recognized as

58
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:42.560
a potential security risk
by whoever reports it.

59
00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:44.900
Third, the vulnerability must be

60
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.005
submitted with
supporting evidence.

61
00:02:48.005 --> 00:02:50.929
And finally, the reported
vulnerability

62
00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.450
can only affect one codebase,

63
00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:57.100
or in other words, only
one program's source code.

64
00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.390
For instance, the
desktop version

65
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.355
of Chrome may be vulnerable,

66
00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:04.225
but the Android
application may not be.

67
00:03:04.225 --> 00:03:07.180
If the reported flaw passes
all of these tests,

68
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.875
it is assigned a CVE ID.

69
00:03:10.875 --> 00:03:12.710
Vulnerabilities added
to the CVE list are

70
00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:16.315
often reviewed by other online
vulnerability databases.

71
00:03:16.315 --> 00:03:18.785
These organizations
put them through

72
00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:20.330
additional tests to reveal how

73
00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.160
significant the flaws are

74
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:25.205
and to determine what kind of
threat they pose.

75
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:26.840
One of the most popular is

76
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.980
the NIST National
Vulnerabilities Database.

77
00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.560
The NIST National
Vulnerabilities Database uses

78
00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:36.980
what's known as the common
vulnerability scoring system,

79
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.710
or CVSS, which is

80
00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.480
a measurement system that scores

81
00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:43.565
the severity of a vulnerability.

82
00:03:43.565 --> 00:03:47.420
Security teams use
CVSS as a way of

83
00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:49.520
calculating the impact
a vulnerability

84
00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.370
could have on a system.

85
00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.510
They also use them
to determine how

86
00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:56.125
quickly a vulnerability
should be patched.

87
00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:58.850
The NIST National
Vulnerabilities Database provides

88
00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:02.735
a base score of CVEs
on a scale of 0-10.

89
00:04:02.735 --> 00:04:04.595
Base scores reflect the moment

90
00:04:04.595 --> 00:04:06.395
a vulnerability is evaluated,

91
00:04:06.395 --> 00:04:08.635
so they don't change over time.

92
00:04:08.635 --> 00:04:11.870
In general, a CVSS that scores

93
00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:15.200
below a 4.0 is considered
to be low risk

94
00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.710
and doesn't require
immediate attention.

95
00:04:17.710 --> 00:04:21.620
However, anything above a
9.0 is considered to be

96
00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:22.760
a critical risk to

97
00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.805
company assets that should
be addressed right away.

98
00:04:26.805 --> 00:04:29.270
Security teams commonly
use the CVE list and

99
00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:31.130
CVSS scores as part of

100
00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:33.395
their vulnerability
management strategy.

101
00:04:33.395 --> 00:04:35.930
These references
provide recommendations

102
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.210
for prioritizing security fixes,

103
00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:41.460
like installing software
updates before patches.

104
00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.875
Libraries like the CVE list,

105
00:04:43.875 --> 00:04:46.215
help organizations
answer questions.

106
00:04:46.215 --> 00:04:48.935
Is a vulnerability
dangerous to our business?

107
00:04:48.935 --> 00:04:51.815
If so, how soon
should we address it?

108
00:04:52.815 --> 00:04:54.050
These online libraries
bring together

109
00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:56.555
diverse perspectives
from across the world.

110
00:04:56.555 --> 00:04:58.760
Contributing to this
effort is one of

111
00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:01.115
my favorite parts of
working in this field.

112
00:05:01.115 --> 00:05:02.925
Keep gaining experience,

113
00:05:02.925 --> 00:05:05.670
and I hope you'll
participate too!
