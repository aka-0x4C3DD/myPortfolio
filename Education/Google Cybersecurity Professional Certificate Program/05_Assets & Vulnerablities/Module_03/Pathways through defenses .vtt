00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.865
To defend against attacks,

2
00:00:02.865 --> 00:00:04.650
organizations need
to have more than

3
00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:05.850
just the understanding of

4
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.220
the growing digital
landscape around them.

5
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:11.640
Positioning themselves ahead
of a cyber threat also takes

6
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.200
understanding the type of

7
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.540
attacks that can be
used against them.

8
00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.900
Last time, we began
exploring how the cloud has

9
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.880
expanded the digital
attack surface

10
00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.740
that organizations protect.

11
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.470
As a result, cloud
computing has led to

12
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.425
an increase in the number
attack vectors available.

13
00:00:29.425 --> 00:00:31.095
Attack vectors refer
to the pathways

14
00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:34.335
attackers use to penetrate
security defenses.

15
00:00:34.335 --> 00:00:36.585
Like the doors and
windows of a home,

16
00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:39.165
these pathways are
the exploitable features

17
00:00:39.165 --> 00:00:40.780
of an attack surface.

18
00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:44.680
One example of an attack
vector would be social media.

19
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.530
Another would be removable
media, like a USB drive.

20
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.440
Most people outside of
security assume that

21
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.540
cyber criminals
are the only ones

22
00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.915
out there exploiting
attack vectors.

23
00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:57.770
While attack vectors are used by

24
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.050
malicious hackers to
steal information,

25
00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.805
other groups use them too.

26
00:01:01.805 --> 00:01:03.844
For example, employees

27
00:01:03.844 --> 00:01:07.100
occasionally exploit attack
vectors unintentionally.

28
00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.165
This happens a lot with
social media platforms.

29
00:01:10.165 --> 00:01:13.400
Sometimes, employees post
sensitive company news

30
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.155
that shouldn't have been shared.

31
00:01:15.155 --> 00:01:18.450
At times, this same kind of thing
happens on purpose.

32
00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.690
Social media platforms are also

33
00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:22.835
vectors that
disgruntled employees

34
00:01:22.835 --> 00:01:24.530
use to intentionally share

35
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:27.820
confidential information
that can harm the company.

36
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.080
We all treat attack vectors as

37
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.570
critical risks to
asset security.

38
00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:35.060
Attackers typically
put forth a lot of

39
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.205
effort planning their attacks
before carrying them out.

40
00:01:38.205 --> 00:01:40.910
It's up to us as security
professionals to

41
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:44.270
put an even greater amount of
effort into stopping them.

42
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.685
Security teams do
this by thinking of

43
00:01:46.685 --> 00:01:49.540
each vector with an
attacker mindset.

44
00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.620
This starts with a
simple question,

45
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:54.455
"how would we exploit
this vector?"

46
00:01:54.455 --> 00:01:57.020
We then go through a
step-by-step process

47
00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.700
to answer our question.

48
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.865
First, when practicing
an attacker mindset,

49
00:02:01.865 --> 00:02:03.695
we identify a target.

50
00:02:03.695 --> 00:02:06.875
This could be specific
information, a system,

51
00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:08.765
a person, a group,

52
00:02:08.765 --> 00:02:10.760
or the organization itself.

53
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:14.090
Next, we determine how the
target can be accessed.

54
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:16.790
What information is
available that an attacker

55
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:19.430
might take advantage of
to reach the target?

56
00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.810
Based on that information,

57
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:22.580
the third step is to evaluate

58
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.090
the attack vectors that can
be exploited to gain entry.

59
00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.630
And finally, we find the tools
and methods of attack.

60
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:32.485
What will the attackers
use to carry this out?

61
00:02:33.485 --> 00:02:34.660
Along the way, practicing

62
00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:37.295
an attacker mindset
provides valuable insight

63
00:02:37.295 --> 00:02:39.440
into the best security
controls to implement

64
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:42.315
and the vulnerabilities
that need to be monitored.

65
00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:44.650
Every organization
has a long list

66
00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:46.585
of attack vectors to defend.

67
00:02:46.585 --> 00:02:49.105
While there are a lot of
ways to protect them,

68
00:02:49.105 --> 00:02:51.845
there are a few common
rules for doing this.

69
00:02:52.845 --> 00:02:54.520
One key to defending
attack vectors is

70
00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:57.370
educating users about
security vulnerabilities.

71
00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:00.050
These efforts are usually
tied to an event.

72
00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.290
For example, advising them about

73
00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.210
a new phishing exploit that is

74
00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.535
targeting users in
the organization.

75
00:03:07.535 --> 00:03:08.050
Another rule is applying

76
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:09.755
the principle of
least privilege.

77
00:03:09.755 --> 00:03:12.615
We've explored least privilege
earlier in this section.

78
00:03:12.615 --> 00:03:14.890
It's the idea that
access rights should be

79
00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.690
limited to what's required
to perform a task.

80
00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:19.515
Like we previously explored,

81
00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:22.285
this practice closes
multiple security holes

82
00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.815
inside an organization's
attack surface.

83
00:03:26.815 --> 00:03:27.740
Next, using the right
security controls and

84
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:31.535
tools can go a long way towards
defending attack vectors.

85
00:03:31.535 --> 00:03:33.680
Even the most
knowledgeable employees

86
00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:35.180
make security mistakes,

87
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.740
like accidentally clicking on

88
00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:38.705
a malicious link in an email.

89
00:03:38.705 --> 00:03:41.045
Having the right
security tools in place,

90
00:03:41.045 --> 00:03:42.695
like antivirus software,

91
00:03:42.695 --> 00:03:44.780
helps to defend
attack vectors more

92
00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.635
efficiently and reduce
the risk of human error.

93
00:03:48.635 --> 00:03:49.175
Last but not least,

94
00:03:49.175 --> 00:03:51.365
is building a diverse
security team.

95
00:03:51.365 --> 00:03:54.110
This is one of the best
ways to reduce the risk of

96
00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.020
attack vectors and
prevent future attacks.

97
00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:58.940
Your own unique perspective can

98
00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.400
greatly improve the
security team's ability to

99
00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.500
apply an attacker's
mindset and stay

100
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:05.935
one step ahead of
potential threats.

101
00:04:05.935 --> 00:04:07.550
Keeping yourself informed is

102
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:09.320
always important in this field.

103
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:11.195
You're already off
to a great start,

104
00:04:11.195 --> 00:04:13.560
so keep up the good work!
