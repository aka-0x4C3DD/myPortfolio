00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.490
Here we are at the end of

2
00:00:02.490 --> 00:00:04.740
this section! Can
you believe it?

3
00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:08.010
I had so much fun exploring
the world of vulnerabilities.

4
00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:09.705
I hope you felt the same.

5
00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:12.480
More importantly, I hope
you got a better sense of

6
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:15.570
how complex a landscape
the digital world is.

7
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.390
This environment is filled
with gaps that attackers can

8
00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.525
use to gain unauthorized
access to assets,

9
00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:23.805
making it a challenge to defend.

10
00:00:24.805 --> 00:00:26.955
We've explored a lot of
information this time around,

11
00:00:26.955 --> 00:00:29.760
so let's quickly recap
what we've covered.

12
00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:32.760
You learned about the
vulnerability management process,

13
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.055
starting with the
defense-in-depth model.

14
00:00:35.055 --> 00:00:36.590
You learned about the layers of

15
00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.940
this security framework and

16
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.410
how each of them work together

17
00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.155
to build a stronger defense.

18
00:00:42.155 --> 00:00:43.535
You then learned
about the CVE list

19
00:00:43.535 --> 00:00:46.460
that's used to find
cataloged vulnerabilities.

20
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.930
This is a great addition to

21
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:50.030
your growing security toolbox.

22
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.770
After that, you learned of

23
00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.410
the attack surfaces that
businesses protect.

24
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:57.139
We discussed physical
and digital surfaces

25
00:00:57.139 --> 00:00:59.600
and the challenges of
defending the cloud.

26
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.005
We finished up by exploring
common attack vectors,

27
00:01:03.005 --> 00:01:04.970
where you learned
how security teams

28
00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:06.770
use an attacker mindset to

29
00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:08.570
identify the security gaps

30
00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.030
that cyber criminals
try to exploit.

31
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.400
Every one of the vulnerabilities
that we've discussed

32
00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.055
so far is faced with
a number of threats.

33
00:01:17.055 --> 00:01:17.600
When we get back together,

34
00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.805
we're going to expand
our attacker mindset

35
00:01:19.805 --> 00:01:21.050
even further by

36
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.060
exploring specific
type of attacks

37
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.430
that cybercriminals
commonly use.

38
00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:28.175
We'll look at things like
malware and the techniques

39
00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:31.040
attackers use to compromise
defense systems.

40
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.815
By exploring how these
tools and tactics work,

41
00:01:33.815 --> 00:01:35.330
you'll gain a clearer
understanding

42
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.655
of the threats they pose.

43
00:01:36.655 --> 00:01:40.205
We'll then wrap up by
investigating how security teams

44
00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:41.480
stop these threats from

45
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.165
damaging our
organizations' operations,

46
00:01:44.165 --> 00:01:46.910
their reputation, and
most importantly,

47
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:48.830
their customers and employees.

48
00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.785
You've done a fantastic
job getting to this point.

49
00:01:51.785 --> 00:01:54.890
When you're ready, let's
finish the journey together.

50
00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.230
I'm looking forward to
being back with you again.
