00:00:00.961 --> 00:00:05.480
There's a wide range of vulnerabilities
in systems that need to be found.

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:08.955
Assessing those weaknesses
is a time-consuming process.

3
00:00:08.955 --> 00:00:11.336
To position themselves
ahead of threats and

4
00:00:11.336 --> 00:00:15.392
make the most of their limited resources,
companies start by understanding

5
00:00:15.392 --> 00:00:18.113
the environment surrounding
their operations.

6
00:00:18.113 --> 00:00:22.414
An important part of this is getting
a sense of their attack surface.

7
00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:27.109
An attack surface is all the potential
vulnerabilities that a threat actor

8
00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:28.161
could exploit.

9
00:00:28.161 --> 00:00:33.388
Analyzing the attack surface is usually
the first thing security teams do.

10
00:00:34.388 --> 00:00:38.139
For example, imagine being part of
a security team of an old castle.

11
00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:42.949
Your team would need to decide how
to allocate resources to defenses.

12
00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:44.981
Giant walls, stone towers, and

13
00:00:44.981 --> 00:00:49.597
wooden gates are a few common security
controls of these structures.

14
00:00:49.597 --> 00:00:53.806
While these are all designed to protect
the assets inside from attacks,

15
00:00:53.806 --> 00:00:57.122
they don't exactly account for
all the possibilities.

16
00:00:57.122 --> 00:00:59.828
What if the castle were near the ocean?

17
00:00:59.828 --> 00:01:04.191
If it were, these defenses would be
vulnerable to long range attacks by ship.

18
00:01:04.191 --> 00:01:08.072
A proper understanding of the attack
surface would mean your security team

19
00:01:08.072 --> 00:01:12.148
equipped the castle with catapults that
could deal with these kinds of threats.

20
00:01:13.148 --> 00:01:16.939
Modern organizations need to concern
themselves with both a physical and

21
00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:18.647
digital attack surface.

22
00:01:18.647 --> 00:01:22.627
The physical attack surface is made
up of people and their devices.

23
00:01:22.627 --> 00:01:26.010
This surface can be attacked
from both inside and

24
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.488
outside the organization,
which makes it unique.

25
00:01:30.488 --> 00:01:31.477
For example,

26
00:01:31.477 --> 00:01:35.676
let's consider an unattended laptop
in a public space, like a coffee shop.

27
00:01:35.676 --> 00:01:37.295
The person responsible for

28
00:01:37.295 --> 00:01:42.019
it walked away while sensitive company
information was visible on the screen.

29
00:01:42.019 --> 00:01:45.193
This information is vulnerable
to external threats,

30
00:01:45.193 --> 00:01:49.958
like a business competitor, who can easily
record the information and exploit it.

31
00:01:49.958 --> 00:01:53.703
An internal threat of this attack surface,
on the other hand,

32
00:01:53.703 --> 00:01:55.338
is often angry employees.

33
00:01:55.338 --> 00:01:59.228
These employees might share
an organization's private information on

34
00:01:59.228 --> 00:01:59.806
purpose.

35
00:02:00.806 --> 00:02:04.465
In general, the physical attack surface
should be filled with obstacles that

36
00:02:04.465 --> 00:02:06.438
deter attacks from happening.

37
00:02:06.438 --> 00:02:09.563
We call this process security hardening.

38
00:02:09.563 --> 00:02:13.734
Security hardening is the process
of strengthening a system to

39
00:02:13.734 --> 00:02:17.048
reduce its vulnerabilities and
attack surface.

40
00:02:17.048 --> 00:02:19.837
In other words, hardening is the act of

41
00:02:19.837 --> 00:02:24.412
minimizing the attack surface
by limiting its points of entry.

42
00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:28.687
We do this a lot in security because
the smaller the attack surface,

43
00:02:28.687 --> 00:02:30.487
the easier it is to protect.

44
00:02:30.487 --> 00:02:34.437
In fact, some security controls
that we've explored previously,

45
00:02:34.437 --> 00:02:38.387
like organization policies and
access controls, are common ways that

46
00:02:38.387 --> 00:02:41.747
organizations harden their
physical attack surface.

47
00:02:42.747 --> 00:02:44.879
The digital attack surface
is a bit tougher to harden.

48
00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.518
The digital attack surface includes
everything that's beyond our

49
00:02:48.518 --> 00:02:50.122
organization's firewall.

50
00:02:50.122 --> 00:02:55.416
In other words, it includes anything
that connects to an organization online.

51
00:02:56.416 --> 00:02:59.331
In the past, organizations stored
their data in a single location.

52
00:02:59.331 --> 00:03:02.893
This mainly consisted of servers
that were managed on-site.

53
00:03:02.893 --> 00:03:07.293
Accessing the information stored on
those servers required connecting to

54
00:03:07.293 --> 00:03:09.609
the network the workplace managed.

55
00:03:10.609 --> 00:03:14.525
These days, information is accessed outside
of an organization's network because it's

56
00:03:14.525 --> 00:03:15.699
stored in the cloud.

57
00:03:15.699 --> 00:03:19.107
Information can be accessed
from anywhere in the world.

58
00:03:19.107 --> 00:03:22.840
A person can be in one part of the world,
fly to another place, and

59
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.154
continue working. All while outside
of their organization's network.

60
00:03:28.154 --> 00:03:31.502
Cloud computing has essentially
expanded the digital attack surface.

61
00:03:31.502 --> 00:03:35.651
Quicker access to information is
something we all benefit from, but

62
00:03:35.651 --> 00:03:37.163
it comes with a cost.

63
00:03:37.163 --> 00:03:41.883
Organizations of all sizes are under
more pressure to defend against threats

64
00:03:41.883 --> 00:03:44.216
coming from different entry points.

65
00:03:45.216 --> 00:03:48.411
When we get together next time, we'll
explore why this is such a challenge.
