[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.749 --> 00:00:07.900
My name is Omad, I'm a corporate
operations engineer at Google.

3
00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.480
All I do is solve problems.

4
00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.054
Googlers have problems, they need somebody
to talk to, they usually talk to us.

5
00:00:13.054 --> 00:00:15.259
If you asked me at 18 years
old where I'd be now,

6
00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:18.220
I would have never told you I'd be
working as a security engineer.

7
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:21.514
I would have told you I'd be working
in a prison or I'd be working

8
00:00:21.514 --> 00:00:25.482
as a police officer in some township and
just working a regular 9 to 5 shift.

9
00:00:25.482 --> 00:00:28.588
After high school,
I went on to work at Trenton State Prison,

10
00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:31.483
which is the only maximum
security prison in New Jersey.

11
00:00:31.483 --> 00:00:34.745
It was very stressful, but at the same
time it's what I wanted to do at the time,

12
00:00:34.745 --> 00:00:37.353
or at least, that's what I thought
I wanted to do at that time.

13
00:00:37.353 --> 00:00:39.733
Five years after becoming
a correction officer,

14
00:00:39.733 --> 00:00:42.064
I took the test again to
be a sheriff's officer.

15
00:00:42.064 --> 00:00:45.263
And on the last day of that academy,
I decided this wasn't for me.

16
00:00:45.263 --> 00:00:48.441
I was tired of being on my face doing
pushups, I was tired of being yelled at.

17
00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:52.080
I went home and I did what everybody
else would do, do a Google search.

18
00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:54.567
And I saw one for Google and
it was a residency program,

19
00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:57.076
it was at the top of the list and
I applied to it as a joke.

20
00:00:57.076 --> 00:00:59.302
I even told my friends at the time,
I'm just going to apply this,

21
00:00:59.302 --> 00:01:00.066
I'm not going to get in.

22
00:01:00.066 --> 00:01:03.648
I had no reference, no connections,
I knew nobody that worked at Google.

23
00:01:03.648 --> 00:01:06.247
And within a couple of days a recruiter
reached out to me, she said,

24
00:01:06.247 --> 00:01:08.276
"I think you're a great fit,
you're a career changer.

25
00:01:08.276 --> 00:01:11.976
I like your application, I like your
resume, I think you'd be a great fit."

26
00:01:11.976 --> 00:01:14.952
All the interviewers liked my background,
they liked that I was self taught.

27
00:01:14.952 --> 00:01:16.827
A lot of interviewers were
able to relate to me.

28
00:01:16.827 --> 00:01:18.259
They said, "Hey, I did the same thing."

29
00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:21.233
From there, I was offered the job and
I started my career.

30
00:01:21.233 --> 00:01:22.661
When I was in orientation,

31
00:01:22.661 --> 00:01:26.470
somebody right next to me was actually
the valedictorian of Princeton.

32
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:30.419
Here I am with no college degree,
no exposure, no work experience, and

33
00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:31.863
I'm in the same company.

34
00:01:31.863 --> 00:01:33.094
For career changers,

35
00:01:33.094 --> 00:01:36.810
what you have that other people
don't have is a different mindset.

36
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:40.753
You're coming from experience outside of
the technical space that you can transfer

37
00:01:40.753 --> 00:01:42.055
into the technical space.

38
00:01:42.055 --> 00:01:45.505
Don't forget that we all have skillsets
that can help you in the field.

39
00:01:45.505 --> 00:01:46.967
That's what employers are looking for,

40
00:01:46.967 --> 00:01:48.655
that's what hiring
managers are looking for.

41
00:01:48.655 --> 00:01:51.395
One thing I learned as a correction
officer is how to assess risk.

42
00:01:51.395 --> 00:01:54.534
Every situation is different, just
like the security space. Every risk is

43
00:01:54.534 --> 00:01:57.795
different. Every vulnerability is
different. Every threat is different.

44
00:01:57.795 --> 00:01:59.535
You can teach somebody tech, but

45
00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:03.140
you can't teach them a life
of skills outside of tech.

46
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.507
If I were to go back and tell my 18 year
old self one piece of advice, it would be,

47
00:02:07.507 --> 00:02:08.949
don't be scared, do it.

48
00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.040
A career in cybersecurity is very fun.

49
00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:11.990
It's very interesting.

50
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:13.240
It will work your brain.

51
00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:15.321
It changed my life,
it'll change yours as well.
