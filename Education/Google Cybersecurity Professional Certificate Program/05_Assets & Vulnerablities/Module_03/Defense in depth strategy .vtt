1
00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.780
A layered defense is
difficult to penetrate.

2
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:05.265
When one barrier fails,

3
00:00:05.265 --> 00:00:07.800
another takes its place
to stop an attack.

4
00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.300
Defense in depth is

5
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.195
a security model that
makes use of this concept.

6
00:00:12.195 --> 00:00:13.620
It's a layered approach to

7
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.515
vulnerability management
that reduces risk.

8
00:00:16.515 --> 00:00:19.650
Defense in depth is
commonly referred to as

9
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.450
the castle approach because it

10
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.285
resembles the layered
defenses of a castle.

11
00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:25.755
In the Middle Ages,

12
00:00:25.755 --> 00:00:28.575
these structures were very
difficult to penetrate.

13
00:00:28.575 --> 00:00:30.864
They featured
different defenses,

14
00:00:30.864 --> 00:00:32.960
each unique in its design, that

15
00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.485
posed different challenges
for attackers.

16
00:00:35.485 --> 00:00:38.345
For example, a
water-filled barrier

17
00:00:38.345 --> 00:00:40.325
called a moat usually formed

18
00:00:40.325 --> 00:00:42.740
a circle around the castle,
preventing threats like

19
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:45.685
large groups of attackers from
reaching the castle walls.

20
00:00:45.685 --> 00:00:49.130
The few soldiers that made
it past the first layer of

21
00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.960
defense were then faced with

22
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.155
a new challenge,
giant stone walls.

23
00:00:54.155 --> 00:00:56.375
A vulnerability of
these structures

24
00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:58.025
were that they could be climbed.

25
00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:01.475
If attackers tried exploiting
that weakness, guess what?

26
00:01:01.475 --> 00:01:03.575
They were met with
another layer of defense,

27
00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:05.735
watch towers, filled
with defenders

28
00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:08.405
ready to shoot arrows and
keep them from climbing!

29
00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:10.400
Each level of defense of

30
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.610
these medieval structures
minimized the risk of

31
00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.475
attacks by identifying
vulnerabilities and

32
00:01:16.475 --> 00:01:20.120
implementing a security control
should one system fail.

33
00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.035
Defense in depth works
in a similar way.

34
00:01:23.035 --> 00:01:25.190
The defense in depth concept

35
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.700
can be used to
protect any asset.

36
00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.350
It's mainly used in
cybersecurity to protect

37
00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.260
information using a
five layer design.

38
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:36.950
Each layer features a number
of security controls that

39
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.360
protect information as it

40
00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.565
travels in and out of the model.

41
00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:42.230
The first layer of defense in

42
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:44.270
depth is the perimeter layer.

43
00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.340
This layer includes
some technologies

44
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:47.915
that we've already explored,

45
00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:50.005
like usernames and passwords.

46
00:01:50.005 --> 00:01:51.620
Mainly, this is

47
00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.640
a user authentication layer
that filters external access.

48
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.640
Its function is to
only allow access to

49
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.930
trusted partners to reach
the next layer of defense.

50
00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.400
Second, the network
layer is more

51
00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.815
closely aligned
with authorization.

52
00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:08.780
The network layer is made up of

53
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.960
other technologies like
network firewalls and others.

54
00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.975
Next, is the endpoint layer.

55
00:02:13.975 --> 00:02:16.070
Endpoints refer to the devices

56
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.825
that have access on a network.

57
00:02:17.825 --> 00:02:20.269
They could be devices
like a laptop,

58
00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:22.415
desktop, or a server.

59
00:02:22.415 --> 00:02:24.830
Some examples of
technologies that protect

60
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.955
these devices are
anti-virus software.

61
00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:31.430
After that, we get to
the application layer.

62
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.425
This includes all the interfaces

63
00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:35.795
that are used to interact
with technology.

64
00:02:35.795 --> 00:02:38.180
At this layer,
security measures are

65
00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.760
programmed as part
of an application.

66
00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.795
One common example is
multi-factor authentication.

67
00:02:44.795 --> 00:02:47.225
You may be familiar
with having to enter

68
00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:50.675
both your password
and a code sent by SMS.

69
00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:54.040
This is part of the
application layer of defense.

70
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.980
And finally, the fifth layer of
defense is the data layer.

71
00:02:57.980 --> 00:02:59.930
At this layer, we've arrived at

72
00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:02.210
the critical data that
must be protected,

73
00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:05.035
like personally
identifiable information.

74
00:03:05.035 --> 00:03:07.850
One security control
that is important here in

75
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:11.555
this final layer of defense
is asset classification.

76
00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:13.205
Like I mentioned earlier,

77
00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:15.710
information passes in
and out of each of

78
00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.330
these five layers whenever
it's exchanged over a network.

79
00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:22.580
There are many more security
controls aside from the few

80
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.080
that I mentioned that are part

81
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.090
of the defense in depth model.

82
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.280
A lot of businesses design

83
00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.735
their security systems using
the defense in-depth model.

84
00:03:31.735 --> 00:03:34.010
Understanding this
framework hopefully

85
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:35.750
gives you a better sense of how

86
00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:38.090
an organization's
security controls work

87
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:41.550
together to protect
important assets.
