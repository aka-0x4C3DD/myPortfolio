00:00:04.596 --> 00:00:06.890
Hi, I'm Niru, and
I lead the red team at Google.

3
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:11.780
The red team at Google simulates attackers
that are trying to hack into Google.

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.940
They function as a sparring partner for
the blue team, that is, the teams that

5
00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.051
build security controls, detection
pipelines, or respond to incidents.

6
00:00:20.051 --> 00:00:25.002
So we help test all of those
by simulating adversaries.

7
00:00:25.002 --> 00:00:28.949
So we hack into Google to make
it harder to hack into Google.

8
00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:32.145
So it's like, hey,
we found these issues with your system,

9
00:00:32.145 --> 00:00:36.087
now here are some recommendations we have,
and how can we help you fix this?

10
00:00:36.087 --> 00:00:41.353
Thinking like an attacker is approaching
a problem like an adversary.

11
00:00:41.353 --> 00:00:44.077
I generally have a predisposition
to think like an attacker.

12
00:00:44.077 --> 00:00:45.110
[LAUGH].

13
00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.971
It started when I was a kid and
I used to play video games, and

14
00:00:48.971 --> 00:00:53.546
I used to ask, oh, do I have to beat
the game in the way it's intended?

15
00:00:53.546 --> 00:00:56.737
Do I have to get the objective
in the standard path?

16
00:00:56.737 --> 00:01:00.688
Looking at a system and
asking the question, can I break into it?

17
00:01:00.688 --> 00:01:02.069
How do I break into it?

18
00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:03.871
What is likely to fail?

19
00:01:03.871 --> 00:01:06.058
If it fails, what does that give me?

20
00:01:06.058 --> 00:01:09.496
It's about taking apart systems and
trying to understand it.

21
00:01:09.496 --> 00:01:13.310
Threat modeling is integral to almost
anything a security professional does.

22
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.308
It's about challenging assumptions.

23
00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:18.563
It's about approaching things
from a different perspective.

24
00:01:18.563 --> 00:01:22.740
Rather than looking at the system from
the perspective of a developer who is

25
00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.802
thinking about, how do I build the system
in a way that works for people?

26
00:01:26.802 --> 00:01:31.072
You're putting on the hat of an attacker
and saying, if I looked at the system,

27
00:01:31.072 --> 00:01:32.496
how would I break into it?

28
00:01:32.496 --> 00:01:36.320
It's important for all security
professionals to think like an attacker

29
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:40.330
because you code more defensively,
you build things more defensively, and

30
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:42.254
you break things more offensively.

31
00:01:42.254 --> 00:01:46.151
And what that means is you're building
in this resilience into the system, and

32
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:50.164
you're building in all these safeguards
that are going to help protect the data,

33
00:01:50.164 --> 00:01:51.695
the systems, and the people.

34
00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:54.783
In order to build my attacker mindset,

35
00:01:54.783 --> 00:01:58.441
what I did is I would go
pick people's brains.

36
00:01:58.441 --> 00:02:01.419
What that means is I can
grab time with them and say,

37
00:02:01.419 --> 00:02:03.717
hey, how do you approach the system?

38
00:02:03.717 --> 00:02:06.506
What are the assumptions you're making?

39
00:02:06.506 --> 00:02:09.807
How do you build out the security
safeguards that you're thinking about?

40
00:02:09.807 --> 00:02:14.734
My advice for people who are trying
to build their own attacker mindset

41
00:02:14.734 --> 00:02:19.161
is go talk to people,
be it in local meetups, in conferences,

42
00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:23.774
find yourself a CTF group and
play these competitions with them.

43
00:02:23.774 --> 00:02:27.653
See how each person in the team approaches
certain things and solves for it.

44
00:02:27.653 --> 00:02:32.215
Almost everything we do on a daily basis
is online these days, like banking is

45
00:02:32.215 --> 00:02:37.218
online, grocery shopping is online,
the electricity grid, the water supplies.

46
00:02:37.218 --> 00:02:40.811
All of this has happened in
a short span of time, and

47
00:02:40.811 --> 00:02:45.675
now people are taking a step back and
say, what does that mean for us?

48
00:02:45.675 --> 00:02:50.463
And cybersecurity folks are the ones who
help make sure these systems are locked

49
00:02:50.463 --> 00:02:53.406
down and
protected against these adversaries.

50
00:02:53.406 --> 00:02:58.630
If you're inquisitive, if you like taking
things apart, if you like solving things,

51
00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.950
if you want to help make things secure,
you should join cybersecurity.
