00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.139
Our exploration of the
vulnerability management process

2
00:00:04.139 --> 00:00:07.185
so far has been focused
on a couple of topics.

3
00:00:07.185 --> 00:00:08.970
We've discussed how
vulnerabilities

4
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.320
influence the
design of defenses.

5
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:12.810
We've also talked about how

6
00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:14.550
common vulnerabilities
are shared.

7
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:16.950
A topic we're yet to cover is

8
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.740
how vulnerabilities are
found in the first place.

9
00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:21.930
Weaknesses and
flaws are generally

10
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.495
found during a
vulnerability assessment.

11
00:00:24.495 --> 00:00:26.280
A vulnerability assessment is

12
00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:27.960
the internal review process of

13
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.300
an organization's
security systems.

14
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.090
These assessments work
similar to the process of

15
00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.970
identifying and categorizing
vulnerabilities

16
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:37.455
on the CVE list.

17
00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:39.030
The main difference is

18
00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:41.735
the organization's
security team performs,

19
00:00:41.735 --> 00:00:45.230
evaluates, scores, and
fixes them on their own.

20
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:46.850
Security analysts play

21
00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.270
a key role throughout
this process.

22
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.050
Overall, the goal of

23
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.700
a vulnerability assessment is to

24
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.460
identify weak points
and prevent attacks.

25
00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.950
They're also how security
teams determine whether

26
00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.550
their security controls
meet regulatory standards.

27
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.220
Organizations perform
vulnerability assessments a lot.

28
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:07.520
Because companies
have so many assets

29
00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:09.500
to protect, security teams

30
00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.960
sometimes need to
select which area

31
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.845
to focus on through
vulnerability assessments.

32
00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:17.490
Once they decide
what to focus on,

33
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:19.670
vulnerability assessments
typically follow

34
00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:21.365
a four-step process.

35
00:01:21.365 --> 00:01:23.675
The first step is
identification.

36
00:01:23.675 --> 00:01:25.550
Here, scanning tools and

37
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.495
manual testing are used
to find vulnerabilities.

38
00:01:28.495 --> 00:01:30.530
During the identification step,

39
00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.880
the goal is to understand

40
00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.160
the current state of
a security system,

41
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:36.005
like taking a picture of it.

42
00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:37.820
A large number of findings

43
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.330
usually appear after
identification.

44
00:01:40.330 --> 00:01:44.285
The next step of the process
is vulnerability analysis.

45
00:01:44.285 --> 00:01:45.890
During this step, each of

46
00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:49.100
the vulnerabilities that
were identified are tested.

47
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.440
By being a digital
detective, the goal of

48
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:53.090
vulnerability analysis is to

49
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.225
find the source of the problem.

50
00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:58.549
The third step of the
process is risk assessment.

51
00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:00.455
During this step of the process,

52
00:02:00.455 --> 00:02:03.145
a score is assigned to
each vulnerability.

53
00:02:03.145 --> 00:02:06.305
This score is assigned
based on two factors:

54
00:02:06.305 --> 00:02:09.515
how severe the impact would
be if the vulnerability were

55
00:02:09.515 --> 00:02:13.000
to be exploited and the
likelihood of this happening.

56
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.900
Vulnerabilities uncovered during

57
00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.940
the first two steps
of this process

58
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.180
often outnumber the people
available to fix them.

59
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:24.290
Risk assessments are a way
of prioritizing resources to

60
00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:26.090
handle the vulnerabilities
that need to be

61
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:28.295
addressed based on their score.

62
00:02:29.295 --> 00:02:30.140
The fourth and final step of

63
00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.675
vulnerability assessment
is remediation.

64
00:02:32.675 --> 00:02:35.240
It's during this step that
the vulnerabilities

65
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.970
that can impact the
organization are addressed.

66
00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.910
Remediation occurs depending on

67
00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:41.740
the severity score assigned

68
00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:43.370
during the risk assessment step.

69
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.475
This part of the
process is normally

70
00:02:45.475 --> 00:02:48.310
a joint effort between
the security staff and IT

71
00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:50.650
teams to come up with
the best approach to

72
00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:53.615
fixing the vulnerabilities
that were uncovered earlier.

73
00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:56.290
Examples of remediation
steps might include

74
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.840
things like enforcing
new security procedures,

75
00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.625
updating operating systems,

76
00:03:00.625 --> 00:03:02.830
or implementing system patches.

77
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.810
Vulnerability
assessments are great

78
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.105
for identifying the
flaws of a system.

79
00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:09.160
Most organizations use them to

80
00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.560
search for problems
before they happen.

81
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.155
But how do we know
where to search?

82
00:03:14.155 --> 00:03:16.120
When we get together again, we'll

83
00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:19.310
explore how companies
figure this out.
