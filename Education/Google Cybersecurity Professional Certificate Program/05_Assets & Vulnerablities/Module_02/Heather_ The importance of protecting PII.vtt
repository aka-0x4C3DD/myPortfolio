Hello, my name is
Heather and I'm

2
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.615
the Vice President of Security
Engineering at Google.

3
00:00:09.615 --> 00:00:11.790
PII is everywhere.

4
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.250
It's a fundamental part of how

5
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.725
we are all working
online all the time.

6
00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.840
If you are using
online resources,

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.455
you are probably putting your
PII out there somewhere.

8
00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.860
There's some of your PII
that lots of people know,

9
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.465
such as your name.

10
00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:29.730
And then there's sensitive data that

11
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.010
you don't want very
many people to know,

12
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:34.410
such as your bank account number

13
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.545
or your private medical
health information.

14
00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:40.400
And so we make these distinctions often

15
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.600
because this kind of

16
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.805
information needs to be
handled differently.

17
00:00:43.805 --> 00:00:45.845
Everything that we do now,

18
00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:49.400
from school to voting,

19
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:53.445
to registering our car
happens online.

20
00:00:53.445 --> 00:00:57.410
And because of that, it's so
important that we have safety

21
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.240
built-in by default into all of

22
00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.880
our systems. Here's some tips.

23
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:03.920
You should always encrypt
the data as much as you

24
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.460
can when it's being
stored at rest.

25
00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:09.935
And secondly, when it's
transitting over the Internet,

26
00:01:09.935 --> 00:01:14.270
we always want to encrypt
it using TLS or SSL.

27
00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.610
Third, within your company,

28
00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.815
you should think very clearly

29
00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:21.245
about who has access
to that data.

30
00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:24.980
It should be almost no one
if it's very sensitive.

31
00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.140
And in the rare cases where

32
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.705
somebody does need
to access that data,

33
00:01:29.705 --> 00:01:32.405
there should be a
record of that access,

34
00:01:32.405 --> 00:01:36.200
who accessed it, and a
justification as to why.

35
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.245
And you should have a
program to look

36
00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:42.705
at the audit records
for that data.

37
00:01:42.705 --> 00:01:46.040
The most important thing
to remember is if you have

38
00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.670
a situation where PII
has been compromised,

39
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.970
remember that's someone's
personal information and

40
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.915
your response wants to be
grounded in that reality.

41
00:01:56.915 --> 00:01:59.810
They need to be able to
trust the infrastructure,

42
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.885
the systems, the
websites, the devices.

43
00:02:02.885 --> 00:02:04.430
They need to be able to trust

44
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:05.930
the experience they're having.

45
00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.540
For me, that's the
mission: To help

46
00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:12.330
keep billions of people
safe online every day.
