1
00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:04.544
Protecting data is a fundamental
feature of security controls.

2
00:00:04.544 --> 00:00:08.806
When it comes to keeping information
safe and secure, hashing and encryption

3
00:00:08.806 --> 00:00:11.709
are powerful, yet limited tools.

4
00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:12.707
Managing who or

5
00:00:12.707 --> 00:00:18.100
what has access to information is
also key to safeguarding information.

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:22.174
The next series of controls that we'll
be exploring are access controls,

7
00:00:22.174 --> 00:00:25.583
the security controls that
manage access, authorization, and

8
00:00:25.583 --> 00:00:27.550
accountability of information.

9
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.316
When done well, access controls
maintain data confidentiality,

10
00:00:32.316 --> 00:00:34.510
integrity, and availability.

11
00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.750
They also get users
the information they need quickly.

12
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.304
These systems are commonly broken down
into three separate, yet related functions

13
00:00:43.304 --> 00:00:47.480
known as the authentication,
authorization, and accounting framework.

14
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.546
Each control has its own protocol and
systems that make them work.

15
00:00:51.546 --> 00:00:56.422
In this video, let's get comfortable with
the basics of the first one on the list,

16
00:00:56.422 --> 00:00:57.548
authentication.

17
00:00:58.548 --> 00:01:02.220
Authentication systems are access
controls that serve a very basic purpose.

18
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:05.748
They ask anything attempting
to access information

19
00:01:05.748 --> 00:01:08.133
this simple question: who are you?

20
00:01:08.133 --> 00:01:12.314
Organizations go about collecting
answers to these questions differently,

21
00:01:12.314 --> 00:01:15.302
depending on the objectives
of their security policy.

22
00:01:15.302 --> 00:01:18.209
Some are more thorough than others,
but in general,

23
00:01:18.209 --> 00:01:22.650
responses to this question can be based
on three factors of authentication.

24
00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:27.246
The first is knowledge. Authentication by
knowledge refers to something the user

25
00:01:27.246 --> 00:01:28.690
knows, like a password or

26
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.700
the answer to a security question
they provided previously.

27
00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.513
Another factor is ownership,
referring to something the user possesses.

28
00:01:37.513 --> 00:01:42.422
A commonly used type of authentication
by ownership is a one-time passcode, or OTP.

29
00:01:42.422 --> 00:01:46.490
You've probably experienced
these at one time or another.

30
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.883
They're a random number
sequence that an application or website

31
00:01:49.883 --> 00:01:53.850
will send you via text or
email and ask you to provide.

32
00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.857
Last is characteristic. Authentication
by this factor is something the user is.

33
00:01:58.857 --> 00:02:03.722
Biometrics, like fingerprint scans on your
smartphone, are example of this type of

34
00:02:03.722 --> 00:02:04.879
authentication.

35
00:02:04.879 --> 00:02:09.046
While not used everywhere, this form of
authentication is becoming more common

36
00:02:09.046 --> 00:02:12.560
because it's much tougher for
criminals to impersonate someone

37
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.830
if they have to mimic a fingerprint or
facial scan as opposed to a password.

38
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:20.999
The information provided during
authentication needs to match

39
00:02:20.999 --> 00:02:23.950
the information on file for
these access controls to work.

40
00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.898
When the credentials don't match,
authentication fails and access is denied.

41
00:02:27.898 --> 00:02:31.334
When they match, access is granted.

42
00:02:32.334 --> 00:02:35.086
Incorrectly denying access
can be frustrating to anyone.

43
00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:37.510
To make access systems more convenient,

44
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.844
many organizations these
days rely on single sign-on.

45
00:02:40.844 --> 00:02:42.201
Single sign-on, or

46
00:02:42.201 --> 00:02:47.214
SSO, is a technology that combines
several different logins into one.

47
00:02:47.214 --> 00:02:50.839
Can you imagine having to reintroduce
yourself every time you meet up with

48
00:02:50.839 --> 00:02:51.980
a friend?

49
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.001
That's exactly the sort
of problem SSO solves.

50
00:02:56.001 --> 00:03:00.248
Instead of requiring users to authenticate
over and over again, SSO establishes

51
00:03:00.248 --> 00:03:05.508
their identity once, allowing them to
gain access to company resources faster.

52
00:03:05.508 --> 00:03:10.198
While SSO systems are helpful when it
comes to speeding up the authentication process,

53
00:03:10.198 --> 00:03:14.540
they present a significant
vulnerability when used alone.

54
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.104
Denying access to authorized
users can be frustrating,

55
00:03:18.104 --> 00:03:23.100
but you know what's even worse? Incorrectly
granting access to the wrong user.

56
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:27.613
SSO technology is great, but not if
it relies on just a single factor of

57
00:03:27.613 --> 00:03:33.090
authentication. Adding more authentication
factors strengthen these systems.

58
00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:37.799
Multi-factor authentication, or
MFA, is a security measure, which requires

59
00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:43.380
a user to verify their identity in two or
more ways to access a system or network.

60
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.694
MFA combines two or more independent
credentials, like knowledge and

61
00:03:47.694 --> 00:03:51.740
ownership, to prove that someone
is who they claim to be.

62
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.422
SSO and MFA are often used in
conjunction with one another

63
00:03:55.422 --> 00:03:59.409
to layer the defense capabilities
of authentication systems.

64
00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:03.568
When both are used, organizations
can ensure convenient access

65
00:04:03.568 --> 00:04:04.850
that is also secure.

66
00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:06.685
Now that we covered authentication,

67
00:04:06.685 --> 00:04:09.700
we're ready to explore the second
part of the framework.

68
00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.527
Next, we'll learn about authorization!
