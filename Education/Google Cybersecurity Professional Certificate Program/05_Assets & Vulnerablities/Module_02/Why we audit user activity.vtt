00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.210
Have you ever wondered if
your employer is keeping

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:06.030
a record of when you log into
company systems?

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.100
Well, they are, if they're implementing

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.785
the third and final function
of the authentication,

5
00:00:10.785 --> 00:00:13.140
authorization, and
accounting framework.

6
00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.820
Accounting is the practice of

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.415
monitoring the access
logs of a system.

8
00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:19.780
These logs contain
information like who

9
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:22.275
accessed the system, and
when they accessed it,

10
00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:24.255
and what resources they used.

11
00:00:25.255 --> 00:00:26.990
Security analysts use
access logs a lot.

12
00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.250
The data they contain
is a helpful way to

13
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.370
identify trends, like
failed login attempts.

14
00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:33.980
They're also used to uncover

15
00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.840
hackers who have
gained access to

16
00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:37.340
a system, and for

17
00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:39.695
detecting an incident,
like a data breach.

18
00:00:40.695 --> 00:00:42.934
In this field, access
logs are essential.

19
00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:45.170
Oftentimes, analyzing them is

20
00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.030
the first procedure
you'll follow

21
00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:49.355
when investigating
a security event.

22
00:00:49.355 --> 00:00:53.210
So, how do access logs compile
all this useful information?

23
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.570
Let's examine this more closely.

24
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.595
Anytime a user
accesses a system,

25
00:00:58.595 --> 00:01:00.860
they initiate what's
called a session.

26
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:04.205
A session is a sequence
of network HTTP

27
00:01:04.205 --> 00:01:05.900
basic auth requests and

28
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.680
responses associated
with the same user,

29
00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.710
like when you visit a website.

30
00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.030
Access logs are essentially
records of sessions that

31
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:15.770
capture the moment a user enters

32
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.870
a system until the
moment they leave it.

33
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:21.080
Two actions are triggered
when the session begins.

34
00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:23.900
The first is the creation
of a session ID.

35
00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:26.660
A session ID is a unique
token that identifies

36
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.680
a user and their device
while accessing the system.

37
00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.480
Session IDs are attached
to the user until

38
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.465
they either close their browser
or the session times out.

39
00:01:36.465 --> 00:01:37.130
The second action that takes

40
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.120
place at the start
of a session is

41
00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.000
an exchange of session cookies

42
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.310
between a server
and a user's device.

43
00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:46.670
A session cookie is a
token that websites use to

44
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:48.395
validate a session
and determine how

45
00:01:48.395 --> 00:01:50.840
long that session should last.

46
00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.910
When cookies are exchanged

47
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:55.040
between your computer
and a server,

48
00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.410
your session ID is
read to determine

49
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.650
what information the
website should show you.

50
00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.875
Cookies make web sessions
safer and more efficient.

51
00:02:03.875 --> 00:02:05.690
The exchange of tokens means that

52
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.400
no sensitive information, like

53
00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.620
usernames and
passwords, are shared.

54
00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.630
Session cookies
prevent attackers

55
00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.280
from obtaining sensitive data.

56
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:16.480
However, there's other
damage that they can do.

57
00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.090
With a stolen cookie,

58
00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:19.340
an attacker can impersonate

59
00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.395
a user using their
session token.

60
00:02:21.395 --> 00:02:24.470
This kind of attack is known
as session hijacking.

61
00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.840
Session hijacking
is an event when

62
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.340
attackers obtain a legitimate
user's session ID.

63
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.245
During these kinds of attacks,

64
00:02:32.245 --> 00:02:34.610
cyber criminals
impersonate the user,

65
00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.575
causing all sorts of harm.

66
00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:39.220
Money or private
data can be stolen.

67
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.830
If, for example,

68
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:42.680
hijackers obtain
a single sign-on

69
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:44.675
credential from stolen cookies,

70
00:02:44.675 --> 00:02:46.400
they can even gain access to

71
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.805
additional systems that
otherwise seem secure.

72
00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:52.220
This is one reason
why accounting and

73
00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.890
monitoring session
logs is so important.

74
00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:58.490
Unusual activity on access
logs can be an indication that

75
00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:02.255
information has been
improperly accessed or stolen.

76
00:03:02.255 --> 00:03:04.820
At the end of the day,
accounting is how we gain

77
00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:08.340
valuable insight that
makes information safer.
