00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.190
I was fascinated by

2
00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:05.730
a world-wide malware event
that happened in 2017.

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.100
I started watching videos
and preparing to take

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.360
certification tests,
just like you.

5
00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.300
I felt overwhelmed at first,

6
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.280
but my curiosity and passion has

7
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:16.350
driven me to continue
learning in this field.

8
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.840
I always remind
myself that no one is

9
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.820
born knowing everything and

10
00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.500
everyone is on a
learning journey.

11
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.300
Even now, I still
remember what it

12
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.250
was like to start out
in this profession.

13
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.560
So, believe me when I tell
you that you're making

14
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.740
great progress, and I am
proud of your effort!

15
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.140
Now, before looking
ahead to where we're

16
00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.575
headed on our journey into
the world of security,

17
00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:39.195
let's take a moment to look
back on where we've been.

18
00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:41.330
Previously, we focused mostly on

19
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.270
the concept of assets
and risks in security.

20
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.400
We covered topics like
the importance of

21
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.725
managing assets and
keeping them safe.

22
00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:50.945
We discussed how the
digital world presents

23
00:00:50.945 --> 00:00:52.730
new challenges and opportunities

24
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.125
in the field of security.

25
00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:57.305
We also spent some time
exploring security plans.

26
00:00:58.305 --> 00:00:59.045
With this solid foundation,

27
00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:01.910
we're ready to keep expanding
our security mindset.

28
00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.670
In this section, we'll cover
the security controls that

29
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.525
are used to proactively
keep assets safe.

30
00:01:07.525 --> 00:01:10.670
I used the word proactively
there on purpose.

31
00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:12.200
As you'll soon discover,

32
00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.390
these controls are the
protections that we put

33
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.075
in place to stop problems
before they happen.

34
00:01:18.075 --> 00:01:18.860
We're going to begin by taking

35
00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.105
an in-depth look at privacy.

36
00:01:21.105 --> 00:01:23.960
Here, you'll learn about the
effective data handling

37
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.795
processes that keep
information safe.

38
00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:29.000
Next, you'll explore the role of

39
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.095
encryption and hashing in
safeguarding information.

40
00:01:32.095 --> 00:01:33.710
Finally, you'll learn about

41
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:35.360
the standard access
controls that

42
00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.545
companies use to authorize
and authenticate users.

43
00:01:39.545 --> 00:01:44.340
Alright, are you ready to keep
moving ahead? I know I am!
