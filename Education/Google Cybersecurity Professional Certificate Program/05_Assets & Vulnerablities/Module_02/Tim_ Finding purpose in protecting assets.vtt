00:00:04.492 --> 00:00:08.286
My name is Tim and I work on
the Detection and Response team at Google.

3
00:00:08.286 --> 00:00:12.390
You can think of us as the smoke detectors
and the fire departments at Google.

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:17.250
So what our job is, is to detect
harmful activity that may

5
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.019
affect Google and its users.

6
00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:21.872
The stakes here are very, very high.

7
00:00:21.872 --> 00:00:26.161
So imagine what you have on Google,
whether it's docs,

8
00:00:26.161 --> 00:00:31.251
it's pictures, your financial information,
some of your secrets.

9
00:00:31.251 --> 00:00:33.396
Some things that you don't
want anybody to know.

10
00:00:33.396 --> 00:00:35.397
Those are the things
that we're protecting.

11
00:00:35.397 --> 00:00:37.313
Cybersecurity professionals

12
00:00:37.313 --> 00:00:40.874
are there to protect the most
valuable assets of the company.

13
00:00:40.874 --> 00:00:42.814
You'll be there to protect that, and

14
00:00:42.814 --> 00:00:47.471
that direct line from what you're doing to
what the company feels is most important,

15
00:00:47.471 --> 00:00:51.755
most valuable, and protecting that, I think
provides a lot of purpose for folks.

16
00:00:51.755 --> 00:00:54.961
And provides a lot of motivation and
provides the basis and

17
00:00:54.961 --> 00:00:57.919
the foundation for a very,
very satisfying career.

18
00:00:57.919 --> 00:01:02.469
Cybersecurity is a profoundly
rewarding career.

19
00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.186
It is a function that is critical at many,
many companies and

20
00:01:07.186 --> 00:01:10.145
it is a career that is in high demand, and

21
00:01:10.145 --> 00:01:14.787
there is an absolute shortage
of talented labor out there.

22
00:01:14.787 --> 00:01:18.589
So from that aspect, if you're looking for

23
00:01:18.589 --> 00:01:22.596
a path to a viable, long
term, rewarding career,

24
00:01:22.596 --> 00:01:26.929
this is as straight a path
to that as you can imagine.
