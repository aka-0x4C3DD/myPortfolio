00:00:01.067 --> 00:00:04.999
These days, information is in so
many places at once.

2
00:00:04.999 --> 00:00:09.533
As a result, organizations are under
a lot of pressure to implement effective

3
00:00:09.533 --> 00:00:14.771
security controls that protects everyone's
information from being stolen or exposed.

4
00:00:14.771 --> 00:00:19.859
Security controls are safeguards designed
to reduce specific security risks.

5
00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:24.547
They include a wide range of tools that
protect assets before, during, and

6
00:00:24.547 --> 00:00:25.584
after an event.

7
00:00:26.584 --> 00:00:28.458
Security controls can be
organized into three types:

8
00:00:28.458 --> 00:00:31.451
technical, operational, and managerial.

9
00:00:32.451 --> 00:00:35.882
Technical control types include the many
technologies used to protect assets.

10
00:00:35.882 --> 00:00:39.769
This includes encryption,
authentication systems, and others.

11
00:00:40.769 --> 00:00:44.126
Operational controls relate to maintaining
the day-to-day security environment.

12
00:00:44.126 --> 00:00:48.278
Generally, people perform these
controls like awareness training and

13
00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:49.508
incident response.

14
00:00:50.508 --> 00:00:53.921
Managerial controls are centered
around how the other two reduce risk.

15
00:00:53.921 --> 00:00:58.860
Examples of management controls include
policies, standards, and procedures.

16
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.804
Typically, organization's security policy
outlines the controls needed to achieve their goals.

17
00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:08.831
Information privacy plays
a key role in these decisions.

18
00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:13.118
Information privacy is the protection
of unauthorized access and

19
00:01:13.118 --> 00:01:14.657
distribution of data.

20
00:01:14.657 --> 00:01:17.911
Information privacy is
about the right to choose.

21
00:01:17.911 --> 00:01:22.733
People and organizations alike deserve
the right to decide when, how, and

22
00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:26.440
to what extent private
information about them is shared.

23
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.077
Security controls are the technologies
used to regulate information privacy.

24
00:01:32.077 --> 00:01:34.837
For example, imagine using
a travel app to book a flight.

25
00:01:34.837 --> 00:01:38.761
You might browse through a list of
flights and find one at a good price.

26
00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:43.421
To reserve a seat, you enter some personal
information, like your name, email, and

27
00:01:43.421 --> 00:01:45.324
credit card number for payment.

28
00:01:45.324 --> 00:01:49.162
The transaction goes through successfully,
and you booked your flight.

29
00:01:49.162 --> 00:01:52.719
Now, you reasonably expect
the airline company to access this

30
00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.626
information you enter when signing
up to complete the reservation.

31
00:01:57.626 --> 00:02:01.146
However, should everyone at the company
have access to your information?

32
00:02:01.146 --> 00:02:04.479
A person working in the marketing
department shouldn't need access

33
00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:06.152
to your credit card information.

34
00:02:06.152 --> 00:02:10.190
It makes sense to share that information
with a customer support agent.

35
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.636
Except, they should only need to access
it while helping with your reservation.

36
00:02:14.636 --> 00:02:15.990
To maintain privacy,

37
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:20.848
security controls are intended to limit
access based on the user and situation.

38
00:02:20.848 --> 00:02:23.734
This is known as the principle
of least privilege.

39
00:02:24.734 --> 00:02:28.034
Security controls should be designed with
the principle of least privilege in mind.

40
00:02:28.034 --> 00:02:32.433
When they are, they rely on
differentiating between data owners and

41
00:02:32.433 --> 00:02:33.619
data custodians.

42
00:02:34.619 --> 00:02:37.994
A data owner is a person who decides
who can access, edit, use, or

43
00:02:37.994 --> 00:02:39.961
destroy their information.

44
00:02:39.961 --> 00:02:44.767
The idea is very straightforward except
in cases where there are multiple owners.

45
00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:49.028
For example, the intellectual
property of an organization can have

46
00:02:49.028 --> 00:02:50.504
multiple data owners.

47
00:02:51.504 --> 00:02:54.353
A data custodian is anyone or
anything that's responsible for

48
00:02:54.353 --> 00:02:58.213
the safe handling,
transport, and storage of information.

49
00:02:58.213 --> 00:03:00.723
Did you notice that I mentioned, "anything?"

50
00:03:00.723 --> 00:03:04.227
That's because, aside from people,
organizations and

51
00:03:04.227 --> 00:03:08.025
their systems are also custodians
of people's information.

52
00:03:09.025 --> 00:03:11.750
There are other considerations besides
these when implementing security controls.

53
00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:14.211
Remember that data is an asset.

54
00:03:14.211 --> 00:03:19.209
Like any other asset, information privacy
requires proper classification and

55
00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:19.950
handling.

56
00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.723
As we progress in this section,

57
00:03:21.723 --> 00:03:26.074
we'll continue exploring other security
controls that make this possible.
