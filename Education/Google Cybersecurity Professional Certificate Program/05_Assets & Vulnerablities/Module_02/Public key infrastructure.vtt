00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Computers use a lot of

2
00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.630
encryption algorithms to send

3
00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:05.370
and store information online.

4
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.290
They're all helpful
when it comes to hiding

5
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.300
private information, but only

6
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.640
as long as their
keys are protected.

7
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.410
Can you imagine having to keep

8
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.195
track of the encryption
keys protecting

9
00:00:15.195 --> 00:00:19.350
all of your personal information
online? Neither can I,

10
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:21.690
and we don't have to, thanks
to something known

11
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:24.010
as public key infrastructure.

12
00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:27.065
Public key
infrastructure, or PKI,

13
00:00:27.065 --> 00:00:28.640
is an encryption framework that

14
00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.160
secures the exchange of
information online.

15
00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.470
It's a broad system
that makes accessing

16
00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.470
information fast,
easy, and secure.

17
00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.295
So, how does it all work?

18
00:00:39.295 --> 00:00:40.935
PKI is a two-step process.

19
00:00:40.935 --> 00:00:44.255
It all starts with the exchange
of encrypted information.

20
00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:47.059
This involves either
asymmetric encryption,

21
00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:49.595
symmetric encryption, or both.

22
00:00:50.595 --> 00:00:52.295
Asymmetric encryption
involves the use of

23
00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:54.170
a public and private key pair

24
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.570
for encryption and
decryption of data.

25
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:58.430
Let's imagine this as a box that

26
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.290
can be opened with two keys.

27
00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:02.255
One key, the public key,

28
00:01:02.255 --> 00:01:04.130
can only be used to access

29
00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:06.530
the slot and add
items to the box.

30
00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.650
Since the public key can't
be used to remove items,

31
00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.690
it can be copied and
shared with people

32
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.060
all around the
world to add items.

33
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.270
On the other hand, the
second key, the private key,

34
00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:19.130
opens the box fully, so that

35
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:21.275
the items inside can be removed.

36
00:01:21.275 --> 00:01:23.150
Only the owner of the box has

37
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:25.390
access to the private
key that unlocks it.

38
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:27.080
Using a public key allows

39
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.270
the people and servers
you're communicating with

40
00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.620
to see and send you

41
00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.915
encrypted information
that only you

42
00:01:32.915 --> 00:01:34.900
can decrypt with
your private key.

43
00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.965
This two-key system makes

44
00:01:36.965 --> 00:01:39.050
asymmetric encryption
a secure way

45
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:40.895
to exchange information online;

46
00:01:40.895 --> 00:01:43.970
however, it also slows
down the process.

47
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.100
Symmetric encryption,
on the other hand,

48
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.270
is a faster and simpler
approach to key management.

49
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.485
Symmetric encryption
involves the use of

50
00:01:51.485 --> 00:01:54.560
a single secret key to
exchange information.

51
00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.305
Let's imagine the
locked box again.

52
00:01:57.305 --> 00:01:58.760
Instead of two keys,

53
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.360
symmetric encryption
uses the same key.

54
00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:04.655
The owner can use it to
open the box, add items,

55
00:02:04.655 --> 00:02:08.045
and close it again. When they
want to share access,

56
00:02:08.045 --> 00:02:09.560
they can give the secret key to

57
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.300
anyone else to do the same.

58
00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.490
Exchanging a single secret key

59
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.665
may make web
communications faster,

60
00:02:15.665 --> 00:02:17.935
but it also makes
it less secure.

61
00:02:18.935 --> 00:02:22.235
PKI uses both asymmetric
and symmetric encryption,

62
00:02:22.235 --> 00:02:24.875
sometimes in conjunction
with one another.

63
00:02:24.875 --> 00:02:26.810
It all depends on whether speed

64
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.780
or security is the priority.

65
00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:31.639
For example, mobile
chat applications

66
00:02:31.639 --> 00:02:33.320
use asymmetric encryption to

67
00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.720
establish a connection
between people at

68
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:37.069
the start of a conversation

69
00:02:37.069 --> 00:02:38.929
when security is the priority.

70
00:02:38.929 --> 00:02:40.820
Afterwards, when the speed of

71
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.654
communications back-and-forth
is the priority,

72
00:02:43.654 --> 00:02:45.715
symmetric encryption takes over.

73
00:02:46.715 --> 00:02:48.890
While both have their own
strengths and weaknesses,

74
00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:50.945
they share a common
vulnerability,

75
00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:54.380
establishing trust between
the sender and receiver.

76
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.140
Both processes rely
on sharing keys that

77
00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.845
can be misused, lost, or stolen.

78
00:02:59.845 --> 00:03:01.340
This isn't a problem when we

79
00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.230
exchange information
in person because

80
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.540
we can use our senses to
tell the difference between

81
00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.195
those we trust and
those we don't trust.

82
00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:09.920
Computers, on the other hand,

83
00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.800
aren't naturally equipped
to make this distinction.

84
00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.820
That's where the second
step of PKI applies.

85
00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:17.944
PKI addresses the vulnerability

86
00:03:17.944 --> 00:03:19.925
of key sharing by establishing

87
00:03:19.925 --> 00:03:21.530
trust using a system of

88
00:03:21.530 --> 00:03:24.830
digital certificates between
computers and networks.

89
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:27.260
A digital certificate
is a file that

90
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:30.425
verifies the identity
of a public key holder.

91
00:03:30.425 --> 00:03:32.330
Most online information is

92
00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:34.790
exchanged using
digital certificates.

93
00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:36.650
Users, companies, and

94
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.900
networks hold one
and exchange them

95
00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.045
when communicating
information online

96
00:03:41.045 --> 00:03:43.130
as a way of signaling trust.

97
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:44.855
Let's look at an example of how

98
00:03:44.855 --> 00:03:47.005
digital certificates
are created.

99
00:03:48.005 --> 00:03:49.370
Let's say an online
business is about to launch

100
00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.720
their website, and they want to

101
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.660
obtain a digital certificate.

102
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:54.560
When they register
their domain,

103
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:57.440
the hosting company sends
certain information over

104
00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:00.740
to a trusted certificate
authority, or CA.

105
00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.770
The information provided is
usually basic things like

106
00:04:03.770 --> 00:04:05.390
the company name and the country

107
00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:07.315
where its headquarters
are located.

108
00:04:07.315 --> 00:04:10.400
A public key for the
site is also provided.

109
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.410
The certificate
authority then uses

110
00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:15.020
this data to verify the
company's identity.

111
00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.670
When it's confirmed, the CA

112
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:19.250
encrypts the data with
its own private key.

113
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.755
Finally, they create
a digital certificate

114
00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:23.990
that contains the
encrypted company data.

115
00:04:23.990 --> 00:04:26.690
It also contains CA's
digital signature

116
00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:28.549
to prove that it's authentic.

117
00:04:29.549 --> 00:04:32.045
Digital certificates are a
lot like a digital ID badge

118
00:04:32.045 --> 00:04:33.770
that's used online
to restrict or

119
00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.930
grant access to information.

120
00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:39.170
This is how PKI solves
the trust issue.

121
00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.120
Combined with asymmetric and

122
00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:42.250
symmetric encryption,

123
00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:44.240
this two-step approach
to exchanging

124
00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.000
secure information between
trusted sources is

125
00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.970
what makes PKI such a
useful security control.
