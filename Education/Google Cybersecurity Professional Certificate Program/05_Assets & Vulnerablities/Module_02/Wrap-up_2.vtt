00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.850
Our focus in this section was on a major
theme of security: protecting assets.

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.690
A large part of this relates to privacy.

3
00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:12.770
We should all enjoy the right to
decide who can access our information.

4
00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:17.210
As we learned, there are several controls
in place that help secure assets.

5
00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:21.240
We began the section by exploring
effective data handling processes that

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.850
are founded on the principle
of least privilege.

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.890
We then explored the role of encryption
and hashing and safeguarding information.

8
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.450
We explored how symmetric and
asymmetric encryption works and

9
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.730
how hashes further
safeguard data from harm.

10
00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.685
We then turned our attention to standard
access controls. Properly authenticating

11
00:00:40.685 --> 00:00:45.660
and authorizing users is what maintaining
the CIA triad of information is all about!

12
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.710
We used the AAA framework of security
to take a detailed tour of identity and

13
00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:55.609
access management systems and the access
controls that validate whether or not

14
00:00:55.609 --> 00:00:57.925
someone is who they claim to be.

15
00:00:58.925 --> 00:01:00.710
Well done making it through
the first half of the course!

16
00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:04.288
You're making great progress so
far, and I hope you keep it up.

17
00:01:04.288 --> 00:01:08.490
Remember, your background and
experiences are valuable in this field.

18
00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:11.715
This combined with the concepts
we're covering will make you

19
00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:14.500
a valuable contributor
to any security team.

20
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.516
Up until this point, we've been exploring
the defensive side of security, but

21
00:01:18.516 --> 00:01:22.810
security isn't all about planning ahead
and waiting for something to happen.

22
00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:24.442
In the next part of our journey,

23
00:01:24.442 --> 00:01:28.362
we're going to continue developing
a security mindset by taking a more

24
00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:31.912
proactive look at security from
the perspective of attackers.

25
00:01:31.912 --> 00:01:32.980
I'll meet you there!
