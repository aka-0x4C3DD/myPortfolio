00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.530
Congratulations on making it
through the end of this course!

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:07.827
I can hardly believe our
time together is over.

3
00:00:07.827 --> 00:00:10.344
Before moving on in
the certificate program,

4
00:00:10.344 --> 00:00:13.590
I'd like to reflect on all
the amazing progress you've made.

5
00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:17.351
When we started, you were introduced
to a wide range of assets

6
00:00:17.351 --> 00:00:18.900
organizations protect.

7
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.279
Our primary focus was information
security, specifically

8
00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:24.936
digital information.

9
00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:29.349
Here, you learned how asset
classification helps security teams focus

10
00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:32.060
their efforts and prioritize resources.

11
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:35.870
We explored digital assets in
the three states of data.

12
00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.578
We also learned how policies,
standards, and

13
00:00:38.578 --> 00:00:41.370
procedures can mitigate
organizational risk.

14
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.924
Our focus on the NIST cybersecurity
framework introduced you to a commonly used

15
00:00:45.924 --> 00:00:47.980
framework for managing risk.

16
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.190
Afterwards, you learned about fundamental
security systems and controls.

17
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:57.760
You got to explore technology, like
encryption, that's used to protect data

18
00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.929
in all its states.

19
00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:03.018
You also learned how technologies
like public key infrastructure and

20
00:01:03.018 --> 00:01:06.898
digital certificates are used
to maintain the confidentiality,

21
00:01:06.898 --> 00:01:10.170
integrity, and
availability of information online.

22
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.319
And you also explored access controls
that make up the authentication,

23
00:01:14.319 --> 00:01:17.330
authorization, and accounting framework.

24
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:20.870
Next, we explored common
vulnerabilities and systems.

25
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.144
During this part of the course, you got
an inside look into how security teams

26
00:01:25.144 --> 00:01:27.450
position themselves ahead of attacks.

27
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.873
We explored the defense in depth strategy
that's applied to protect information as

28
00:01:31.873 --> 00:01:34.670
it's exchanged between parties online.

29
00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.418
You also learned about the common
vulnerability and exposures list,

30
00:01:38.418 --> 00:01:42.890
the vulnerability assessment process,
and attack surfaces and attack vectors.

31
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.555
We then explored the major
threats to asset security,

32
00:01:46.555 --> 00:01:50.716
like social engineering, malware,
and web-based exploits.

33
00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:54.024
Together, we discussed how these
attacks are carried out and

34
00:01:54.024 --> 00:01:57.550
the way security teams prevent
them from doing damage.

35
00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.980
We then finished up by exploring
the process of threat modeling.

36
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:02.960
We covered so much!

37
00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.530
I really appreciate your
effort throughout it all.

38
00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:10.384
When I first started my career in
security, my goal was to learn, network, and

39
00:02:10.384 --> 00:02:12.166
embrace any opportunity.

40
00:02:12.166 --> 00:02:16.048
I was able to attend security conferences,
receive job tips,

41
00:02:16.048 --> 00:02:20.170
earned references, and
volunteered to gain experience.

42
00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.808
At that time,

43
00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:24.605
I would have never imagined that I'd be
here teaching what I've learned to others.

44
00:02:25.605 --> 00:02:28.949
That just goes to show you, your security
journey is only just beginning.

45
00:02:28.949 --> 00:02:33.400
While our time together is over,
we covered a lot of complex topics,

46
00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:37.100
many of which are areas of
specialization in security.

47
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.353
With the foundation you've built here,

48
00:02:39.353 --> 00:02:43.794
you have a wide range of possibilities
to continue growing in the field.

49
00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:48.114
I'm so glad to have played a part in this
step along your journey into the world of

50
00:02:48.114 --> 00:02:48.767
security.

51
00:02:48.767 --> 00:02:52.501
And I wish you all the best as you
continue forward along your path.
