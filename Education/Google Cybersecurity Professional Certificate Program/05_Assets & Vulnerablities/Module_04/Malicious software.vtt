1
00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.335
People and computers are very
different from one another.

2
00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:06.660
There's one way that we're alike.

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.550
You know how? We're both

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.470
vulnerable to getting
an infection.

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.600
While humans can be
infected by a virus

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.760
that causes a cold or flu,

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.685
computers can be
infected by malware.

8
00:00:18.685 --> 00:00:22.455
Malware is software designed to
harm devices or networks.

9
00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.800
Malware, which is short
for malicious software,

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.900
can be spread in many ways.

11
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.960
For example, it can be

12
00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.570
spread through an
infected USB drive.

13
00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.050
Or also commonly spread
between computers online.

14
00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.210
Devices and systems
that are connected to

15
00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:41.104
the internet are especially
vulnerable to infection.

16
00:00:41.104 --> 00:00:43.100
When a device becomes infected,

17
00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.220
malware interferes with
its normal operations.

18
00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:48.650
Attackers use malware
to take control of

19
00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:50.240
the infected system without

20
00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.375
the user's knowledge
or permission.

21
00:00:52.375 --> 00:00:54.770
Malware has been a
threat to people and

22
00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.155
organizations for a long time.

23
00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:00.530
Attackers have created many
different strains of malware.

24
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:03.400
They all vary in
how they're spread.

25
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.430
Five of the most common types
of malware are a virus,

26
00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.290
worm, trojan,
ransomware, and spyware.

27
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.815
Let's take a look at
how each of them work.

28
00:01:14.815 --> 00:01:17.330
A virus is malicious code
written to interfere with

29
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.040
computer operations and cause

30
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:21.245
damage to data and software.

31
00:01:21.245 --> 00:01:25.180
Viruses typically hide inside
of trusted applications.

32
00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.530
When the infected
program is launched,

33
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:29.240
the virus clones itself and

34
00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.030
spreads to other
files on the device.

35
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:33.950
An important characteristic of

36
00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.480
viruses is that they have to

37
00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.785
be activated by the user
to start the infection.

38
00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:42.110
The next kind of malware
doesn't have this limitation.

39
00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.390
A worm is malware that can

40
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.930
duplicate and spread itself
across systems on its own.

41
00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:50.420
While viruses require
users to perform

42
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.020
an action like opening
a file to duplicate,

43
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.150
worms use an infected
device as a host.

44
00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:59.660
They scan the connected
network for other devices.

45
00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:02.315
Worms then infect
everything on the network

46
00:02:02.315 --> 00:02:05.395
without requiring an action
to trigger the spread.

47
00:02:06.395 --> 00:02:07.640
Viruses and worms are
delivered through

48
00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.665
phishing emails
and other methods

49
00:02:09.665 --> 00:02:11.570
before they infect a device.

50
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.850
Making sure you click
links only from

51
00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.800
trusted sources is one way

52
00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.765
to avoid these
types of infection.

53
00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:20.495
However, attackers have designed

54
00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:22.190
another form of malware that

55
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.365
can get past this precaution.

56
00:02:25.365 --> 00:02:27.230
A trojan, or Trojan horse,

57
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.575
is malware that looks like a
legitimate file or program.

58
00:02:30.575 --> 00:02:32.120
The name is a reference to

59
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.660
an ancient Greek legend that's
set in the city of Troy.

60
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.840
In Troy, a group of
soldiers hid inside

61
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.550
a giant wooden horse that was

62
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.965
presented as a gift
to their enemies.

63
00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:46.270
It was accepted and brought
inside the city walls.

64
00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.780
Later that evening,
the soldiers inside

65
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.400
of the horse climbed out
and attacked the city.

66
00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.105
Like this ancient tale,

67
00:02:53.105 --> 00:02:56.435
attackers design trojans
to appear harmless.

68
00:02:56.435 --> 00:03:00.170
This type of malware is
typically disguised as files or

69
00:03:00.170 --> 00:03:02.180
useful applications to trick

70
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.360
their target into
installing them.

71
00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.670
Attackers often use
trojans to gain access and

72
00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.230
install another kind of
malware called ransomware.

73
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.855
Ransomware is a type of
malicious attack where attackers

74
00:03:14.855 --> 00:03:17.090
encrypt an
organization's data and

75
00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:19.600
demand payment to
restore access.

76
00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:23.180
These kind of attacks have
become very common these days.

77
00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:24.710
A unique feature of

78
00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:26.420
ransomware attacks is that they

79
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:28.850
make themselves known
to their targets.

80
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.410
Without doing this, they

81
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.555
couldn't collect the
money they demand.

82
00:03:32.555 --> 00:03:35.255
Normally, they decrypt
the hidden data

83
00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:37.600
as soon as the sum
of money is paid.

84
00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.219
Unfortunately,
there's no guarantee

85
00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:42.320
they won't return
to demand more.

86
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.845
The last type of malware I
want to mention is spyware.

87
00:03:45.845 --> 00:03:48.080
Spyware is malware
that's used to

88
00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.800
gather and sell information
without consent.

89
00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.400
Consent is a keyword
in this case.

90
00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:54.920
Organizations also

91
00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.810
collect information
about their customers,

92
00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:59.330
like their browsing habits
and purchase history.

93
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.130
However, they always give

94
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:03.625
their customers the
ability to opt out.

95
00:04:03.625 --> 00:04:05.510
Cybercriminals, on
the other hand,

96
00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:07.925
use spyware to
steal information.

97
00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:09.530
They use spyware attacks to

98
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:11.630
collect data like
login credentials,

99
00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.460
account PINs, and other types of

100
00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:16.870
sensitive information for
their own personal gain.

101
00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.700
There are many other
types of malware besides

102
00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:22.595
these and new forms
are always evolving.

103
00:04:22.595 --> 00:04:24.350
They all pose a serious risk

104
00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.725
to individuals and
organizations.

105
00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:28.580
Next time, we'll explore how

106
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:32.850
security teams detect and
remove these kinds of threats.
