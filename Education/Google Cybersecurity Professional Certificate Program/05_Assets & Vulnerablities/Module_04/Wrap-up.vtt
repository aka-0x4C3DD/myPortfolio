00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.925
Managing threats is a major part

2
00:00:02.925 --> 00:00:04.950
of what security
professionals do.

3
00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.585
In this part of the course,

4
00:00:06.585 --> 00:00:08.190
we've explored some common types

5
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.780
of cyber threats that you'll

6
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.465
likely encounter in the
field. Let's review.

7
00:00:14.465 --> 00:00:16.650
We started off discussing
social engineering.

8
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.260
You learned that attackers
have a variety of ways to

9
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.440
trick their targets into
sharing private information.

10
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.870
Social engineering
techniques rely on

11
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.050
exploiting people's trust
and willingness to help.

12
00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.825
Phishing attacks are one
of the most common ways

13
00:00:30.825 --> 00:00:34.005
that attackers go about
manipulating their targets.

14
00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:36.555
Next, we explored malware.

15
00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:39.585
Here, we discussed the
major classes of malware,

16
00:00:39.585 --> 00:00:42.210
like viruses,
trojans, and worms.

17
00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:44.745
You learned how to spot
signs of infection.

18
00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:46.640
You also learned how malware has

19
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.230
evolved and become more
sophisticated over the years.

20
00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:52.670
After that, we turned
our attention to

21
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:57.070
web-based exploits,
specifically injection attacks.

22
00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.075
You learned about
cross-site scripting

23
00:00:59.075 --> 00:01:00.455
and SQL injection,

24
00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:02.000
two of the most common types of

25
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.250
attacks facing
organizations online.

26
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:07.240
We discussed how each of these
attacks are carried out.

27
00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.660
You also learned about how

28
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:12.140
web applications can be
protected from malicious code.

29
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.935
Finally, we explored the
threat modeling process.

30
00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:18.170
You learned the process
that security teams

31
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.530
use to perform these exercises.

32
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.120
Unfortunately, cyberattacks and

33
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.070
security breaches
are a reality that

34
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.385
we're challenged with
on a regular basis.

35
00:01:27.385 --> 00:01:29.540
However, being aware of

36
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:31.370
the type of threats
that exist and

37
00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:33.380
the threat modeling
process provides

38
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.910
an important foundation for

39
00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:37.860
your work as a security analyst.
