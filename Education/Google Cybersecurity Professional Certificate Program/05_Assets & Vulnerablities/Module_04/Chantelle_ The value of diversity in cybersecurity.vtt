00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.790
My name is Chantelle.

2
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.040
I'm a Security Engineer
here at Google,

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:09.510
and I am part of

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.675
the security and implement,
and scaling team.

5
00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:14.130
We secure and monitor

6
00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:18.000
systems that contain
sensitive information.

7
00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.180
My background, initially
I was going to

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:24.120
be a heart surgeon and
then I took chemistry,

9
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.250
I took chem 1, and I was like,

10
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.935
no that's not happening.

11
00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:30.960
My interest in cybersecurity

12
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:32.490
came from a TV show called Mr.

13
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.505
Robot. It's about
a vigilante hacker

14
00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:37.545
trying to save the world.

15
00:00:37.545 --> 00:00:41.670
And from there, that kind of piqued
my interest in security,

16
00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.520
and so that's a
great foundation.

17
00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.550
Valuing diversity in
security is important

18
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.165
because we're exposed to a
broad range of thinking.

19
00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:55.610
That helps to inspire a
lot of creative ideas and

20
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.710
different perspectives
and different ways

21
00:00:57.710 --> 00:00:59.300
of tackling a problem and

22
00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.770
that kind of leads us forward

23
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.515
into being better
security engineers.

24
00:01:03.515 --> 00:01:08.115
Our Manager, Laureen always
steps in to tell us,

25
00:01:08.115 --> 00:01:10.620
"Don't be so quick
to find a solution.

26
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.965
Don't be so quick to solve
the problems yourselves."

27
00:01:12.965 --> 00:01:15.290
We have a wide range of

28
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.500
security engineers and
connections to our disposal,

29
00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:22.640
and she encourages us to
go out and seek them out,

30
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.060
and then to come back and
then have us settle in and

31
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.160
brainstorm all of
these ideas that we've

32
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.270
collected after we've went
out and tried to find it.

33
00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.250
We've ultimately
almost always come up

34
00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:35.900
with the best possible outcome

35
00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.780
that we can ever come up with.

36
00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.530
My advice for people to get into

37
00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.130
the industry is get out
there and be proactive.

38
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.440
I definitely recommend joining

39
00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.000
up the security
community on Twitter.

40
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
There's a huge security
community on Twitter right now.

41
00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000
That shares a bunch
of resources,

42
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.350
opportunities, job positions,

43
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.230
and are definitely
open to talking to

44
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.000
anyone that's interested
in getting into the field

45
00:02:00.245 --> 00:02:05.165
but just don't know how. I
recommend security as a career.

46
00:02:05.165 --> 00:02:10.220
Definitely, I think
that for me personally,

47
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.205
I was able to tap into my
rebel side a lot in security.

48
00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:17.200
I found I was able to express

49
00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.000
myself a bit more in security.

50
00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:26.490
It's just a whole
ball of goodness.
