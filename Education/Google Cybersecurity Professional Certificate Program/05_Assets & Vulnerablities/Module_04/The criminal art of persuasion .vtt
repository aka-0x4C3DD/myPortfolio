00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.000
When you hear the word
"cybercriminal",

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.455
what comes to mind?

3
00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:06.300
You may imagine a hacker

4
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.670
hunched over a computer
in a dark room.

5
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:11.645
If this is what came to
mind, you're not alone.

6
00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:13.050
In fact, this is what

7
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.420
most people outside
of security think of.

8
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:17.820
But online criminals
aren't always that

9
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.595
different from those
operating in the real world.

10
00:00:21.595 --> 00:00:23.985
Malicious hackers are just
one type of online criminal.

11
00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:26.090
They are a specific
kind that relies on

12
00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:28.310
sophisticated computer
programming skills

13
00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.125
to pull off their attacks.

14
00:00:30.125 --> 00:00:32.150
There are other ways
to commit crimes

15
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.345
that don't require
programming skills.

16
00:00:34.345 --> 00:00:36.230
Sometimes, criminals rely on

17
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:39.305
a more traditional
approach, manipulation.

18
00:00:40.305 --> 00:00:40.730
Social engineering is

19
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.800
a manipulation
technique that exploits

20
00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.030
human error to gain

21
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.470
private information,
access, or valuables.

22
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:49.880
These tactics trick
people into breaking

23
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.020
normal security procedures
on the attacker's behalf.

24
00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.190
This can lead to data exposures,

25
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:57.740
widespread malware
infections, or

26
00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.695
unauthorized access to
restricted systems.

27
00:01:00.695 --> 00:01:03.650
Social engineering attacks
can happen anywhere.

28
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:06.169
They happen online, in-person,

29
00:01:06.169 --> 00:01:08.195
and through other interactions.

30
00:01:08.195 --> 00:01:10.820
Threat actors use many
different tactics

31
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.515
to carry out their attacks.

32
00:01:13.515 --> 00:01:15.785
Some attacks can take a
matter of seconds to perform.

33
00:01:15.785 --> 00:01:18.815
For example, someone
impersonating

34
00:01:18.815 --> 00:01:20.750
tech support asks an employee

35
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.225
for their password to
fix their computer.

36
00:01:23.225 --> 00:01:26.165
Other attacks can take
months or longer,

37
00:01:26.165 --> 00:01:27.470
such as threat actors

38
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.695
monitoring an employee's
social media.

39
00:01:29.695 --> 00:01:32.210
The employee might post a
comment saying they've gotten

40
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.510
a temporary position in a
new role at the company.

41
00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.110
An attacker might use an
opportunity like this to target

42
00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.600
the temporary worker,
who is likely to be

43
00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.465
less knowledgeable about
security procedures.

44
00:01:45.465 --> 00:01:46.295
Regardless of the timeframe,

45
00:01:46.295 --> 00:01:48.710
knowing what to look for
can help you quickly

46
00:01:48.710 --> 00:01:51.760
identify and stop an
attack in its tracks.

47
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.265
There are multiple stages of
social engineering attacks.

48
00:01:55.265 --> 00:01:57.710
The first is usually to prepare.

49
00:01:57.710 --> 00:01:59.360
At this stage, attackers

50
00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.535
gather information
about their target.

51
00:02:01.535 --> 00:02:02.970
Using the intel, they'll

52
00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:05.255
determine the best
way to exploit them.

53
00:02:06.255 --> 00:02:08.665
In the next stage, attackers
establish trust.

54
00:02:08.665 --> 00:02:11.370
This is often referred
to as pretexting.

55
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.730
Here, attackers use
the information they

56
00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.715
gathered earlier to open
a line of communication.

57
00:02:16.715 --> 00:02:19.190
They'll typically disguise
themselves to trick

58
00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.130
their target into a
false sense of trust.

59
00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.695
After that, attackers
use persuasion tactics.

60
00:02:25.695 --> 00:02:28.040
This stage is where the
earlier preparation

61
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.305
really matters.

62
00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:31.249
This is when the
attacker manipulates

63
00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:34.025
their target into
volunteering information.

64
00:02:34.025 --> 00:02:37.040
Sometimes they do this by
using specific vocabulary

65
00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:40.200
that makes them sound like a
member of the organization.

66
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.005
The final stage of the process

67
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:43.835
is to disconnect
from the target.

68
00:02:43.835 --> 00:02:46.205
After they collect the
information they want,

69
00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:48.935
attackers break communication
with their target.

70
00:02:48.935 --> 00:02:51.530
They disappear to
cover their tracks.

71
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:54.955
Criminals who use social
engineering are stealthy.

72
00:02:54.955 --> 00:02:58.200
The digital world has
expanded their capabilities.

73
00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:01.355
It's also created more ways
for them to go unnoticed.

74
00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:05.185
Still, there are ways that we
can prevent their attacks.

75
00:03:06.185 --> 00:03:08.395
Implementing managerial
controls like policies,

76
00:03:08.395 --> 00:03:09.940
standards, and procedures,

77
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:12.170
are one of the first
lines of defense.

78
00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:14.840
For example, businesses
often follow

79
00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:16.970
the patch management
standard defined in

80
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:19.960
NIST Special Publication 800-40.

81
00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.010
These standards
are used to create

82
00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:24.455
procedures for updating
operating systems,

83
00:03:24.455 --> 00:03:27.755
applications, and firmware
that can be exploited.

84
00:03:28.755 --> 00:03:29.990
Staying informed
of trends is also

85
00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:32.980
a major priority for any
security professional.

86
00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:34.940
An even better defense against

87
00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:36.410
social engineering attacks is

88
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.200
sharing what you
know with others.

89
00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.670
Attackers play on our
natural curiosity

90
00:03:40.670 --> 00:03:42.485
and desire to help one another.

91
00:03:42.485 --> 00:03:44.300
Their hope is that
targets won't think

92
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.145
too hard about what's going on.

93
00:03:46.145 --> 00:03:48.335
Teaching the signs
of attack to others

94
00:03:48.335 --> 00:03:50.965
goes a long way towards
preventing threats.

95
00:03:51.965 --> 00:03:53.780
Social engineering is a
threat to the assets and

96
00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:57.125
privacy of both individuals
and organizations.

97
00:03:57.125 --> 00:03:59.300
Malicious attackers
use a variety of

98
00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.704
tactics to confuse and
manipulate their targets.

99
00:04:02.704 --> 00:04:04.940
When we get back
together next time,

100
00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:06.200
we're going to explore one of

101
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:08.000
the most commonly
used techniques

102
00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.330
that's a major problem for
organizations of all sizes.
