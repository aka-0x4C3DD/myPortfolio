00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:03.930
Here we are! The final
section of the course.

2
00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:06.405
What are amazing job
you've done so far!

3
00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:07.620
Putting in the time,

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.510
dedication, and hard
work to get to

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.510
this point is definitely
something to celebrate.

6
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.115
But we're not through yet.

7
00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:15.800
As we near the end
of this course,

8
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.555
now's the time to focus
and finish strong.

9
00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:20.955
Let's turn our
attention to threats.

10
00:00:21.955 --> 00:00:23.249
We've already explored assets,

11
00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:26.370
vulnerabilities, and the
controls used to protect both.

12
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.370
A common theme between
those two topics has

13
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.870
been the wide range of assets

14
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:32.655
and vulnerabilities out there.

15
00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:35.105
The world of threats
is no different.

16
00:00:36.105 --> 00:00:38.255
If you recall, threats
are any circumstance

17
00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:41.455
or event that can
negatively impact assets.

18
00:00:41.455 --> 00:00:43.040
In this part of the course,

19
00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:45.875
you're going to expand your
security mindset by getting

20
00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:47.060
a high-level view of

21
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.440
the most dangerous threats
facing organizations today.

22
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.340
First, we're going to begin by

23
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:54.844
exploring social
engineering tactics,

24
00:00:54.844 --> 00:00:57.170
psychological tricks
that attackers use to

25
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.890
gain unauthorized
access to assets.

26
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.230
Next, we'll explore a common
type of threat that's been

27
00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:06.955
around since the start of
personal computers, malware.

28
00:01:06.955 --> 00:01:08.390
We're going to spend some time

29
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:11.000
investigating the major
types of malware.

30
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.590
After that, we'll turn

31
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.960
our attention to
web-based exploits.

32
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.485
Most organizations these days
operate in a digital space,

33
00:01:18.485 --> 00:01:20.465
and many of them are new to it.

34
00:01:20.465 --> 00:01:22.070
In this section of the course,

35
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:23.690
you're going to
learn about some of

36
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.825
the most common threats that
organizations face online.

37
00:01:27.825 --> 00:01:28.910
Finally, after exploring

38
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.220
common threats that
organizations deal with,

39
00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.930
we're going to wrap
up by exploring

40
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.690
the threat modeling process.

41
00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.800
Understanding threats
is essential for

42
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.605
a security analyst, and
there's a lot to cover.

43
00:01:39.605 --> 00:01:41.790
So, let's get started!
