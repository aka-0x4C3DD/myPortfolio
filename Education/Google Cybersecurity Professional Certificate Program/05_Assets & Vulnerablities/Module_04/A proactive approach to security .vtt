00:00:01.039 --> 00:00:01.939
Preparing for

2
00:00:01.939 --> 00:00:06.892
attacks is an important job that the
entire security team is responsible for.

3
00:00:06.892 --> 00:00:10.708
Threat actors have many tools they
can use depending on their target.

4
00:00:10.708 --> 00:00:11.603
For example,

5
00:00:11.603 --> 00:00:16.534
attacking a small business can be
different from attacking a public utility.

6
00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:21.340
Each have different assets and
specific defenses to keep them safe.

7
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:26.397
In all cases, anticipating attacks
is the key to preparing for them.

8
00:00:26.397 --> 00:00:32.048
In security, we do that by performing
an activity known as threat modeling.

9
00:00:33.048 --> 00:00:35.411
Threat modeling is a process
of identifying assets,

10
00:00:35.411 --> 00:00:39.307
their vulnerabilities, and
how each is exposed to threats.

11
00:00:39.307 --> 00:00:41.109
We apply threat modeling to everything

12
00:00:41.109 --> 00:00:45.994
we protect. Entire systems,
applications, or business processes

13
00:00:45.994 --> 00:00:50.145
all get examined from this
security-related perspective.

14
00:00:51.145 --> 00:00:54.302
Creating threat models is a lengthy and
detailed activity.

15
00:00:54.302 --> 00:00:59.204
They're normally performed by a collection
of individuals with years of experience in

16
00:00:59.204 --> 00:00:59.876
the field.

17
00:00:59.876 --> 00:01:04.139
Because of that, it's considered to
be an advanced skill in security.

18
00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:07.951
However, that doesn't mean
you won't be involved.

19
00:01:08.951 --> 00:01:11.335
There are several threat modeling
frameworks used in the field.

20
00:01:11.335 --> 00:01:14.839
Some are better suited for
network security. Others are better for

21
00:01:14.839 --> 00:01:18.488
things like information security,
or application development.

22
00:01:19.488 --> 00:01:22.240
In general,
there are six steps of a threat model.

23
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.318
The first is to define
the scope of the model.

24
00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:29.818
At this stage, the team determines
what they're building by creating

25
00:01:29.818 --> 00:01:32.748
an inventory of assets and
classifying them.

26
00:01:33.748 --> 00:01:35.946
The second step is to identify threats.

27
00:01:35.946 --> 00:01:39.895
Here, the team defines all
potential threat actors.

28
00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:44.462
A threat actor is any person or
group who presents a security risk.

29
00:01:44.462 --> 00:01:49.324
Threat actors are characterized
as being internal or external.

30
00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:53.576
For example, an internal threat
actor could be an employee

31
00:01:53.576 --> 00:01:56.730
who intentionally expose an asset to harm.

32
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.712
An example of an external threat
actor could be a malicious hacker, or

33
00:02:00.712 --> 00:02:02.070
a competing business.

34
00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.672
After threat actors have been identified,

35
00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:07.987
the team puts together what's
known as an attack tree.

36
00:02:07.987 --> 00:02:12.403
An attack tree is a diagram
that maps threats to assets.

37
00:02:12.403 --> 00:02:16.027
The team tries to be as detailed
as possible when constructing

38
00:02:16.027 --> 00:02:17.915
this diagram before moving on.

39
00:02:18.915 --> 00:02:22.541
Step three of the threat modeling process
is to characterize the environment.

40
00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:26.714
Here, the team applies an attacker
mindset to the business.

41
00:02:26.714 --> 00:02:30.768
They consider how the customers and
employees interact with the environment.

42
00:02:30.768 --> 00:02:35.720
Other factors they consider are external
partners and third party vendors.

43
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.974
At step four, their objective
is to analyze threats.

44
00:02:38.974 --> 00:02:44.431
Here, the team works together to examine
existing protections and identify gaps.

45
00:02:44.431 --> 00:02:48.873
They then rank threats according to
their risk score that they assign.

46
00:02:49.873 --> 00:02:53.332
During step five,
the team decides how to mitigate risk.

47
00:02:53.332 --> 00:02:57.990
At this point, the group creates their
plan for defending against threats.

48
00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:03.070
The choices here are to avoid risk,
transfer it, reduce it, or accept it.

49
00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:05.960
The sixth and
final step is to evaluate findings.

50
00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.917
At this stage, everything that was done
during the exercise is documented,

51
00:03:10.917 --> 00:03:15.279
fixes are applied, and the team makes
note of any successes they had.

52
00:03:15.279 --> 00:03:17.391
They also record any lessons learned, so

53
00:03:17.391 --> 00:03:20.464
they can inform how they
approach future threat models.

54
00:03:21.464 --> 00:03:23.988
That's an overview of the general
threat modeling process.

55
00:03:23.988 --> 00:03:27.369
What we've explored was just
one of many methods that exist.
