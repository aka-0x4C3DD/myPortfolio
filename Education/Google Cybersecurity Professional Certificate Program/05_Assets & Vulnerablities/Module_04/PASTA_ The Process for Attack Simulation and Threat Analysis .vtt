1
00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:05.989
Let's finish exploring threat modeling by
taking a look at real-world scenarios.

2
00:00:05.989 --> 00:00:10.223
This time, we'll use a standard threat
modeling process called PASTA.

3
00:00:11.223 --> 00:00:15.176
Imagine that a fitness company is getting
ready to launch their first mobile app.

4
00:00:15.176 --> 00:00:16.544
Before we can go live,

5
00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:21.657
the company asks their security team to
ensure the app will protect customer data.

6
00:00:21.657 --> 00:00:25.637
The team decides to perform a threat
model using the PASTA framework.

7
00:00:26.637 --> 00:00:29.448
PASTA is a popular threat modeling
framework that's used across many

8
00:00:29.448 --> 00:00:30.229
industries.

9
00:00:30.229 --> 00:00:35.249
PASTA is short for Process for
Attack Simulation and Threat Analysis.

10
00:00:35.249 --> 00:00:38.113
There are seven stages
of the PASTA framework.

11
00:00:38.113 --> 00:00:41.791
Let's go through each of them to help
this fitness company get their app ready.

12
00:00:42.791 --> 00:00:46.199
Stage one of the PASTA threat model
framework is to define business and

13
00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:47.770
security objectives.

14
00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:52.420
Before starting the threat model, the team
needs to decide what their goals are.

15
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.219
The main objective in our example
with the fitness company app is

16
00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.916
protecting customer data.

17
00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:01.395
The team starts by asking a lot
of questions at this stage.

18
00:01:01.395 --> 00:01:04.346
They'll need to understand
things like how personally

19
00:01:04.346 --> 00:01:06.488
identifiable information is handled.

20
00:01:06.488 --> 00:01:09.529
Answering these questions is
a key to evaluate the impact

21
00:01:09.529 --> 00:01:11.945
of threats that they'll
find along the way.

22
00:01:12.945 --> 00:01:16.497
Stage two of the PASTA framework is
to define the technical scope.

23
00:01:16.497 --> 00:01:20.748
Here, the team's focus is to identify
the application components that must be

24
00:01:20.748 --> 00:01:21.530
evaluated.

25
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.412
This is what we discussed
earlier as the attack surface.

26
00:01:25.412 --> 00:01:26.468
For a mobile app,

27
00:01:26.468 --> 00:01:31.197
this will include technology that's
involved while data is at rest and in use.

28
00:01:31.197 --> 00:01:36.983
This includes network protocols, security
controls, and other data interactions.

29
00:01:37.983 --> 00:01:41.949
At stage three of PASTA, the team's
job is to decompose the application.

30
00:01:41.949 --> 00:01:42.937
In other words,

31
00:01:42.937 --> 00:01:47.956
we need to identify the existing controls
that will protect user data from threats.

32
00:01:47.956 --> 00:01:52.855
This normally means working with the
application developers to produce a data

33
00:01:52.855 --> 00:01:53.825
flow diagram.

34
00:01:53.825 --> 00:01:58.752
A diagram like this will show how data
gets from a user's device to the company's

35
00:01:58.752 --> 00:01:59.484
database.

36
00:01:59.484 --> 00:02:04.642
It would also identify the controls in
place to protect this data along the way.

37
00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:06.743
Stage four of PASTA is next.

38
00:02:06.743 --> 00:02:09.718
The focus here is to
perform a threat analysis.

39
00:02:09.718 --> 00:02:12.914
This is where the team gets
into their attacker mindset.

40
00:02:12.914 --> 00:02:17.844
Here, research is done to collect the most
up-to-date information on the type of

41
00:02:17.844 --> 00:02:19.201
attacks being used.

42
00:02:19.201 --> 00:02:23.475
Like other technologies,
mobile apps have many attack vectors.

43
00:02:23.475 --> 00:02:28.305
These change regularly, so the team would
reference resources to stay up-to-date.

44
00:02:29.305 --> 00:02:32.324
Stage five of PASTA is performing
a vulnerability analysis.

45
00:02:32.324 --> 00:02:35.143
In this stage,
the team more deeply investigates

46
00:02:35.143 --> 00:02:39.144
potential vulnerabilities by
considering the root of the problem.

47
00:02:40.144 --> 00:02:43.755
Next is stage six of PASTA, where
the team conducts attack modeling.

48
00:02:43.755 --> 00:02:48.007
This is where the team tests
the vulnerabilities that were analyzed

49
00:02:48.007 --> 00:02:50.401
in stage five by simulating attacks.

50
00:02:50.401 --> 00:02:55.184
The team does this by creating an attack
tree, which looks like a flow chart.

51
00:02:55.184 --> 00:02:59.957
For example, an attack tree for
our mobile app might look like this.

52
00:02:59.957 --> 00:03:04.320
Customer information, like user names and
passwords, is a target.

53
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.379
This data is normally
stored in a database.

54
00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.715
We've learned that databases are
vulnerable to attacks like SQL injection.

55
00:03:11.715 --> 00:03:15.569
So we will add this attack
vector to our attack tree.

56
00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.250
A threat actor might exploit
vulnerabilities caused by unsanitized

57
00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.318
inputs to attack this vector.

58
00:03:22.318 --> 00:03:27.017
The security team uses attack trees
like this to identify attack vectors

59
00:03:27.017 --> 00:03:29.877
that need to be tested
to validate threats.

60
00:03:29.877 --> 00:03:32.724
This is just one branch
of this attack tree.

61
00:03:32.724 --> 00:03:37.178
An application, like a fitness app,
typically has lots of branches with

62
00:03:37.178 --> 00:03:39.430
a number of other attack vectors.

63
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.333
Stage seven of PASTA is to
analyze risk and impact.

64
00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:46.980
Here, the team assembles all
the information they've collected in

65
00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.380
stages one through six.

66
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.543
By this stage, the team is in
position to make informed risk

67
00:03:51.543 --> 00:03:56.123
management recommendations to business
stakeholders that align with their goals.

68
00:03:57.123 --> 00:04:00.261
And with that, we made it all the way
through a threat modeling exercise based

69
00:04:00.261 --> 00:04:01.650
on the PASTA framework!
