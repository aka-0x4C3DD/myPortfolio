1
00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:05.125
Cybercriminals prefer attacks that do
the most amount of damage with the least

2
00:00:05.125 --> 00:00:06.200
amount of effort.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.000
One of the most popular forms of social
engineering that meets this description is phishing.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.295
Phishing is the use of digital
communications to trick people into

5
00:00:15.295 --> 00:00:18.760
revealing sensitive data or
deploying malicious software.

6
00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.381
Phishing leverages many
communication technologies, but

7
00:00:22.381 --> 00:00:26.289
the term is mainly used to describe
attacks that arrive by email.

8
00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:29.235
Phishing attacks don't
just affect individuals.

9
00:00:29.235 --> 00:00:31.805
They are also harmful to organizations.

10
00:00:31.805 --> 00:00:36.405
A single employee that falls for one
of these tricks can give malicious

11
00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:38.406
attackers access to systems.

12
00:00:38.406 --> 00:00:43.539
Once inside, attackers can exploit
sensitive data like customer names and

13
00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:44.831
product secrets.

14
00:00:45.831 --> 00:00:48.605
Attackers who carry out these
attacks commonly use phishing kits.

15
00:00:48.605 --> 00:00:52.616
A phishing kit is a collection of
software tools needed to launch

16
00:00:52.616 --> 00:00:54.300
a phishing campaign.

17
00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:58.320
People with little technical
background can use one of these kits.

18
00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:02.159
Each of the tools inside
are designed to avoid detection.

19
00:01:02.159 --> 00:01:03.761
As a security professional,

20
00:01:03.761 --> 00:01:07.282
you should be aware of the three
main tools inside a phishing kit, so

21
00:01:07.282 --> 00:01:11.970
that you can quickly identify when
they're being used and put a stop to it.

22
00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.390
The first is malicious attachments.

23
00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:19.828
These are files that are infected and can
cause harm to the organization's systems.

24
00:01:20.828 --> 00:01:22.780
Phishing kits also include
fake-data collection forms.

25
00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:26.470
These forms look like legitimate forms,
like a survey.

26
00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:27.809
Unlike a real survey,

27
00:01:27.809 --> 00:01:32.540
they ask for sensitive information that
isn't normally asked for in an email.

28
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.230
The third resource they include
are fraudulent web links.

29
00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:40.630
These open to malicious web pages that
are designed to look like trusted brands.

30
00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:42.496
Unlike actual websites,

31
00:01:42.496 --> 00:01:48.271
these fraudulent sites are built to steal
information, like login credentials.

32
00:01:49.271 --> 00:01:53.450
Cybercriminals can use these tools to
launch a phishing attack in many forms.

33
00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.875
The most common is
through malicious emails.

34
00:01:55.875 --> 00:02:00.096
However, they can use them in
other forms of communication too.

35
00:02:00.096 --> 00:02:03.413
Most recently,
cybercriminals are using smishing and

36
00:02:03.413 --> 00:02:07.161
vishing to trick people into
revealing private information.

37
00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:12.637
Smishing is the use of text messages
to obtain sensitive information or

38
00:02:12.637 --> 00:02:14.700
to impersonate a known source.

39
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.950
You've probably received these
types of messages before.

40
00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:21.038
Not only are smishing
messages annoying to receive,

41
00:02:21.038 --> 00:02:25.580
they're also difficult to prevent.
That's why some attackers send them.

42
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:28.530
Some smishing messages are easy to detect.

43
00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.114
They might show signs of being malicious
like promising a cash reward for

44
00:02:32.114 --> 00:02:34.950
clicking an attached link
that shouldn't be clicked.

45
00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:38.200
Other times, smishing is hard to spot.

46
00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.130
Attackers sometimes use local
area codes to appear legitimate.

47
00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:45.558
Some hackers can even send
messages disguised as friends and

48
00:02:45.558 --> 00:02:50.071
families of their target to fool them
into disclosing sensitive information.

49
00:02:52.120 --> 00:02:55.584
Vishing is the exploitation of
electronic voice communication to obtain

50
00:02:55.584 --> 00:02:58.980
sensitive information or
impersonate a known source.

51
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:02.760
During vishing attacks, criminals
pretend to be someone they're not.

52
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:07.560
For example, attackers might call
pretending to be a company representative.

53
00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:10.420
They might claim that there's
a problem with your account.

54
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.790
And they can offer to fix it if you provide
them with sensitive information.

55
00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:17.652
Most organizations use a few basic
security measures to prevent these and

56
00:03:17.652 --> 00:03:21.150
any other types of phishing
attacks from becoming a problem.

57
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.504
For example, anti-phishing
policies spread awareness and

58
00:03:24.504 --> 00:03:28.250
encourage users to follow data
security procedures correctly.

59
00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:32.722
Employee training resources also help
inform employees about things to look for

60
00:03:32.722 --> 00:03:34.980
when an email looks suspicious.

61
00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.150
Another line of defense against
phishing is securing email inboxes.

62
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.190
Email filters are commonly used to keep
harmful messages from reaching users.

63
00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:49.500
For example, specific email addresses
can be blocked using a blocklist.

64
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.195
Organizations often use other filters, like
allowlists, to specify IP addresses that

65
00:03:54.195 --> 00:03:57.610
are approved to send
mail within the company.

66
00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:01.615
Organizations also use intrusion
prevention systems to look for

67
00:04:01.615 --> 00:04:03.940
unusual patterns in email traffic.

68
00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:08.675
Security analysts use monitoring tools
like this to spot suspicious emails,

69
00:04:08.675 --> 00:04:11.650
quarantine them, and
produce a log of events.

70
00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.239
Phishing campaigns are popular and
dangerous forms of social engineering that

71
00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:18.970
organizations of all
sizes need to deal with.

72
00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:23.679
Just a single compromised password that an
attacker can get their hands on can lead

73
00:04:23.679 --> 00:04:25.450
to a costly data breach.

74
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.605
Now that you're familiar with
the tools these attackers use,

75
00:04:28.605 --> 00:04:31.534
you're better equipped to
spot phishing and prevent it.
