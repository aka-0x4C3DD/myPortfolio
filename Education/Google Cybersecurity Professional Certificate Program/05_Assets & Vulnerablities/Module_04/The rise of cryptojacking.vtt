1
00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.275
Malware has been around
nearly as long as computers.

2
00:00:04.275 --> 00:00:05.835
In its earliest forms,

3
00:00:05.835 --> 00:00:07.575
it was used by troublemakers

4
00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:09.705
as a form of digital vandalism.

5
00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:11.570
In today's digital world,

6
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.800
malware has become
a profitable crime

7
00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.710
that attackers use for
their own financial gain.

8
00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.675
As a security professional,

9
00:00:18.675 --> 00:00:19.860
it's important that you remain

10
00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:21.780
aware of the latest evolutions.

11
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.470
Let's take a closer look at
one way malware has evolved.

12
00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.090
We'll then use this example

13
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.530
to consider how malware can be

14
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.000
spotted and how you can

15
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.290
proactively protect
against malware.

16
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.340
Ransomware is one
of the types of

17
00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:36.580
malware attackers
use to steal money.

18
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:40.525
Another more recent type of
malware is cryptojacking.

19
00:00:40.525 --> 00:00:43.670
Cryptojacking is a form
of malware that installs

20
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.810
software to illegally
mine cryptocurrencies.

21
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.925
You may be familiar with
cryptocurrency from the news.

22
00:00:49.925 --> 00:00:51.590
If you're new to the topic,

23
00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:54.980
cryptocurrencies are a form
of digital money that have

24
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.625
real-world value. Like
physical forms of currency,

25
00:00:58.625 --> 00:01:00.680
there are many different types.

26
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.225
For the most part,

27
00:01:02.225 --> 00:01:05.045
they're referred to
as coins or tokens.

28
00:01:06.045 --> 00:01:07.550
In simple terms, crypto mining is

29
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.475
a process used to
obtain new coins.

30
00:01:10.475 --> 00:01:12.650
Crypto mining is
similar to the process

31
00:01:12.650 --> 00:01:15.560
for mining for other resources, like gold.

32
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.680
Mining for something like
gold involves machinery, such

33
00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:21.980
as trucks and bulldozers, that
can dig through the Earth.

34
00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:23.615
Crypto coins, on the other hand,

35
00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:26.030
use computers instead. Rather

36
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.200
than digging through the Earth,

37
00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.090
the computers run
software that dig

38
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.540
through billions of
lines of encrypted code.

39
00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:35.475
When enough code is processed,
a crypto coin can be found.

40
00:01:36.475 --> 00:01:37.970
Generally, more
computers mining for

41
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.140
coins mean more cryptocurrency
can be discovered.

42
00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.725
Criminals unfortunately
figured this out.

43
00:01:43.725 --> 00:01:46.640
Beginning in 2017, cryptojacking

44
00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.045
malware started being used to
gain unauthorized control

45
00:01:50.045 --> 00:01:53.155
of personal computers to
mine cryptocurrency.

46
00:01:54.155 --> 00:01:54.560
Since that time,

47
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.740
cryptojacking techniques have
become more sophisticated.

48
00:01:57.740 --> 00:01:59.510
Criminals now regularly target

49
00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:02.210
vulnerable servers to spread
their mining software.

50
00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:03.860
Devices that communicate with

51
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.980
the infected server become
infected themselves.

52
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:09.964
The malicious code then
runs in the background,

53
00:02:09.964 --> 00:02:12.430
mining for coins
unknown to anyone.

54
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.170
Cryptojacking software
is hard to detect.

55
00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:17.420
Luckily, security professionals

56
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:19.780
have sophisticated
tools that can help.

57
00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.930
An intrusion detection system,
or IDS, is an application

58
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.850
that monitors system activity

59
00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.045
and alerts some
possible intrusions.

60
00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:31.160
When abnormal activity is
detected like, malware

61
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.075
mining for coins, the IDS
alerts security personnel.

62
00:02:36.075 --> 00:02:36.725
Despite their usefulness,

63
00:02:36.725 --> 00:02:39.260
detection systems have
a major drawback.

64
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:42.380
New forms of malware
can remain undetected.

65
00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.180
Fortunately, there are

66
00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.460
subtle signs that
indicate a device is

67
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:48.740
infected with
cryptojacking software

68
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:50.680
or other forms of malware.

69
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.880
By far the most telling sign of

70
00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.570
a cryptojacking
infection is slowdown.

71
00:02:55.570 --> 00:02:58.820
Other signs include
increased CPU usage,

72
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:02.375
sudden system crashes, and
fast draining batteries.

73
00:03:02.375 --> 00:03:05.585
Another sign is unusually
high electricity costs

74
00:03:05.585 --> 00:03:07.880
related to the resource-
intensive process

75
00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.160
of crypto mining.

76
00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.940
It's also good to
know that there are

77
00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:12.560
certain measures you can take to

78
00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.420
reduce the likelihood
of experiencing

79
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.690
a malware attack
like cryptojacking.

80
00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:18.890
These defenses include
things like using

81
00:03:18.890 --> 00:03:22.025
browser extensions
designed to block malware,

82
00:03:22.025 --> 00:03:24.230
using ad blockers, disabling

83
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.190
JavaScript, and staying
alert on the latest trends.

84
00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:29.810
Security analysts can
also educate others in

85
00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:32.470
their organizations
on malware attacks.

86
00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.150
While cryptojacking is
still relatively new,

87
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.160
attacks are becoming
more common.

88
00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:38.795
The type of malicious code

89
00:03:38.795 --> 00:03:41.615
cybercriminals spread is
continually evolving.

90
00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:43.580
It takes many years
of experience

91
00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:45.830
to analyze new forms of malware.

92
00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:48.230
Nevertheless, you're well on

93
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.660
your way towards helping
defend against these threats.
