00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.424
What do you picture when you
think about the security field?

2
00:00:03.424 --> 00:00:07.294
This might make you think of a dark room
with people hunched over their computers.

3
00:00:07.294 --> 00:00:12.053
Maybe you picture a person in a lab
carefully analyzing evidence.

4
00:00:12.053 --> 00:00:15.926
Or, maybe you imagine a guard standing
watch in front of a building.

5
00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:19.115
The truth is,
no matter what thoughts cross your mind,

6
00:00:19.115 --> 00:00:22.723
all of these examples are part
of the wide world of security.

7
00:00:23.723 --> 00:00:25.161
Hi, my name is Da'Queshia.

8
00:00:25.161 --> 00:00:28.518
I have worked as a security engineer for
four years.

9
00:00:28.518 --> 00:00:31.457
I'm excited to be your instructor for
this course and

10
00:00:31.457 --> 00:00:33.560
share some of my experience with you.

11
00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.822
At Google, I'm part of a diverse team
of security professionals who all have

12
00:00:37.822 --> 00:00:40.654
different backgrounds and
unique perspectives.

13
00:00:40.654 --> 00:00:44.467
For example,
in my role, I work to secure Gmail.

14
00:00:44.467 --> 00:00:48.534
Part of my daily activities include
developing new security features and

15
00:00:48.534 --> 00:00:52.874
fixing vulnerabilities in the application
to make email safer for our users.

16
00:00:53.874 --> 00:00:57.033
Some members of my team began working in
security after graduating from college.

17
00:00:57.033 --> 00:01:00.632
Many others found their way into the field
after years of working in another

18
00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:01.212
industry.

19
00:01:01.212 --> 00:01:04.534
Security teams come in all
different shapes and sizes.

20
00:01:04.534 --> 00:01:07.179
Each member of a team has a role to play.

21
00:01:07.179 --> 00:01:10.861
While our specific functions
within the group differ,

22
00:01:10.861 --> 00:01:15.571
we all share the same objective:
protecting valuable assets from harm.

23
00:01:15.571 --> 00:01:19.905
Accomplishing this mission involves
a combination of people, processes,

24
00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:20.578
and tools.

25
00:01:20.578 --> 00:01:24.103
In this course, you'll learn
about each of these in detail.

26
00:01:25.103 --> 00:01:27.979
First, you'll be introduced to
the world of asset security.

27
00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:31.736
You'll learn about the variety of
assets that organizations protect and

28
00:01:31.736 --> 00:01:35.140
how these factor into a company's
overall approach to security.

29
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.611
Then, you'll begin exploring
the security systems and

30
00:01:38.611 --> 00:01:43.755
controls that teams use to proactively
protect people and their information.

31
00:01:43.755 --> 00:01:47.091
All systems have weaknesses
that can be improved upon.

32
00:01:47.091 --> 00:01:52.213
When those weaknesses are neglected or
ignored, they can lead to serious problems.

33
00:01:52.213 --> 00:01:56.290
In this section of the course,
you'll focus on common vulnerabilities in systems

34
00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:00.000
and the ways security teams
stay ahead of potential problems.

35
00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.395
Finally, you'll learn about
the threats to asset security.

36
00:02:03.395 --> 00:02:07.705
You'll also be introduced to the threat
modeling process that security teams use

37
00:02:07.705 --> 00:02:10.086
to stay one step ahead
of potential attacks.

38
00:02:10.086 --> 00:02:10.996
In this field,

39
00:02:10.996 --> 00:02:15.630
we try to do everything possible to avoid
being put in a compromised position.

40
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.754
By the end of this course, you'll have
a clearer picture of the ways people,

41
00:02:19.754 --> 00:02:23.955
processes, and technology work together
to protect all that's important.

42
00:02:23.955 --> 00:02:25.132
Throughout the course,

43
00:02:25.132 --> 00:02:28.950
you'll also get an idea of the exciting
career opportunities available to you.

44
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.796
Security truly is
an interdisciplinary field.

45
00:02:32.796 --> 00:02:35.393
Your background and
perspective is an asset.

46
00:02:35.393 --> 00:02:39.521
Whether you're a recent college
graduate or starting a new career path,

47
00:02:39.521 --> 00:02:42.930
the security field presents
a wide range of possibilities.

48
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:44.423
So what do you say?

49
00:02:44.423 --> 00:02:46.296
Are you ready to go on
this journey with me?
