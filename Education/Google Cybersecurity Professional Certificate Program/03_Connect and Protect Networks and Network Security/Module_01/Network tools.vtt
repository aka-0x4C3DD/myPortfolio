00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.060
In this video,
you'll learn about

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:04.500
the common devices that make up

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:06.675
a network. Let's get started.

4
00:00:07.675 --> 00:00:08.820
A hub is a network device that

5
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.935
broadcasts information to
every device on the network.

6
00:00:11.935 --> 00:00:14.790
Think of a hub like a radio
tower that broadcasts

7
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.315
a signal to any radio tuned
to the correct frequency.

8
00:00:19.315 --> 00:00:21.185
Another network
device is a switch.

9
00:00:21.185 --> 00:00:23.160
A switch makes
connections between

10
00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:25.560
specific devices on a
network by sending

11
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:27.550
and receiving data between them.

12
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:30.305
A switch is more
intelligent than a hub.

13
00:00:30.305 --> 00:00:34.055
It only passes data to
the intended destination.

14
00:00:34.055 --> 00:00:36.890
This makes switches
more secure than hubs,

15
00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.470
and enables them to control
the flow of traffic

16
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.314
and improve network performance.

17
00:00:42.314 --> 00:00:44.320
Another device that we'll
discuss is a router.

18
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.160
A router is a
network device that

19
00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:48.215
connects multiple
networks together.

20
00:00:49.215 --> 00:00:50.960
For example, if a
computer in one network

21
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.975
wants to send information to
a tablet on another network,

22
00:00:53.975 --> 00:00:56.690
then the information will
be transferred as follows:

23
00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.460
First, the information travels

24
00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:00.365
from the computer to the router.

25
00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:02.870
Then, the router reads the
destination address,

26
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.915
and forwards the data to the
intended network's router.

27
00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:08.000
Finally, the receiving router

28
00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.400
directs that information
to the tablet.

29
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.050
Finally, let's discuss modems.

30
00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:14.840
A modem is a device
that connects

31
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.490
your router to the internet,

32
00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.705
and brings internet
access to the LAN.

33
00:01:19.705 --> 00:01:22.310
For example, if a computer from
one network wants to send

34
00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:24.080
information to a
device on a network

35
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.110
in a different
geographic location,

36
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.850
it would be transferred
as follows:

37
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:31.550
The computer would send
information to the router,

38
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.110
and the router would then transfer

39
00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.785
the information through
the modem to the internet.

40
00:01:35.785 --> 00:01:38.870
The intended recipient's modem
receives the information,

41
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:40.520
and transfers it to the router.

42
00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.770
Finally, the recipient's
router forwards

43
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.770
that information to the
destination device.

44
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.115
Network tools such
as hubs, switches,

45
00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:52.280
routers, and modems
are physical devices.

46
00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.560
However, many
functions performed by

47
00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.300
these physical devices can be

48
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.105
completed by
virtualization tools.

49
00:02:00.105 --> 00:02:01.250
Virtualization
tools are pieces of

50
00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:04.445
software that perform
network operations.

51
00:02:04.445 --> 00:02:07.430
Virtualization tools
carry out operations

52
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:10.070
that would normally be
completed by a hub, switch,

53
00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.540
router, or modem,

54
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:14.395
and they are offered by
Cloud service providers.

55
00:02:14.395 --> 00:02:16.550
These tools provide
opportunities for

56
00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.015
cost savings and scalability.

57
00:02:19.015 --> 00:02:20.450
You'll learn more about them later

58
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.490
in the
certificate program.

59
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:24.530
Now you've explored
some common devices

60
00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:26.670
that make up a
network. Coming up,

61
00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.900
you're going to learn more
about cloud computing,

62
00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.940
and how networks can be
designed using cloud services.
