00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:05.420
Welcome! Before you can understand
the importance of securing a network,

2
00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.119
you need to know what a network is.

3
00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:10.690
A network is a group of connected devices.

4
00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.708
At home, the devices connected to
your network might be your laptop,

5
00:00:14.708 --> 00:00:19.015
cell phones, and smart devices, like
your refrigerator or air conditioner.

6
00:00:19.015 --> 00:00:22.410
In an office, devices like workstations,
printers, and

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.380
servers all connect to the network.

8
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.286
The devices on a network can communicate
with each other over network cables, or

9
00:00:30.286 --> 00:00:31.820
wireless connections.

10
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:35.982
Networks in your home and
office can communicate with networks in other locations,

11
00:00:35.982 --> 00:00:38.737
and the devices on them.

12
00:00:39.737 --> 00:00:43.443
Devices need to find each other on
a network to establish communications.

13
00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:49.100
These devices will use unique addresses, or
identifiers, to locate each other.

14
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.966
The addresses will ensure that
communications happens with

15
00:00:51.966 --> 00:00:53.660
the right device.

16
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.060
These are called the IP and MAC addresses.

17
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.350
Devices can communicate
on two types of networks:

18
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.595
a local area network, also known as a LAN,

19
00:01:03.595 --> 00:01:07.100
and a wide area network, also known as a WAN.

20
00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:08.886
A local area network, or LAN,

21
00:01:08.886 --> 00:01:14.200
spans a small area like an office
building, a school, or a home.

22
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.299
For example, when a personal
device like your cell phone or tablet

23
00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:21.100
connects to the WIFI in your house,
they form a LAN.

24
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.390
The LAN then connects to the internet.

25
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:28.612
A wide area network or WAN spans
a large geographical area like a city, state,

26
00:01:28.612 --> 00:01:30.214
or country.

27
00:01:30.214 --> 00:01:33.451
You can think of
the internet as one big WAN.

28
00:01:33.451 --> 00:01:36.715
An employee of a company in
San Francisco can communicate and

29
00:01:36.715 --> 00:01:40.561
share resources with another employee
in Dublin, Ireland over the WAN.

30
00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:45.074
Now that you've learned about
the structure and types of networks,

31
00:01:45.074 --> 00:01:48.789
meet me in an upcoming video to learn
about the devices that connect to them.
