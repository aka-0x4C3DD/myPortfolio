00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:05.010
Networks help organizations
communicate and connect.

2
00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:09.407
But communication makes network attacks
more likely because it gives a malicious

3
00:00:09.407 --> 00:00:12.912
actor an opportunity to take
advantage of vulnerable devices and

4
00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.380
unprotected networks.

5
00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.159
Communication over a network happens when
data is transferred from one point to

6
00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:23.311
another. Pieces of data are typically
referred to as data packets.

7
00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:28.599
A data packet is a basic unit of
information that travels from one

8
00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:30.880
device to another within a network.

9
00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.595
When data is sent from one device to
another across a network, it is sent as

10
00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:39.871
a packet that contains information about
where the packet is going, where it's

11
00:00:39.871 --> 00:00:43.504
coming from, and
the content of the message.

12
00:00:44.504 --> 00:00:46.841
Think about data packets like
a piece of physical mail.

13
00:00:46.841 --> 00:00:49.670
Imagine you want to send
a letter to a friend.

14
00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.330
The envelope will need to have the address
where you want the letter to go

15
00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:57.217
and your return address.
Inside the envelope is a letter that contains

16
00:00:57.217 --> 00:00:59.890
the message that you
want your friend to read.

17
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.020
A data packet is very
similar to a physical letter.

18
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.775
It contains a header that includes
the internet protocol address, the IP

19
00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:13.230
address, and the media access control, or
MAC, address of the destination device.

20
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.466
It also includes a protocol number that
tells the receiving device what to do with

21
00:01:17.466 --> 00:01:19.170
the information in the packet.

22
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.946
Then there's the body of the packet,
which contains the message that needs to

23
00:01:22.946 --> 00:01:25.090
be transmitted to the receiving device.

24
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.391
Finally, at the end of the packet,
there's a footer,

25
00:01:28.391 --> 00:01:30.498
similar to a signature on a letter,

26
00:01:30.498 --> 00:01:35.310
the footer signals to the receiving
device that the packet is finished.

27
00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.353
The movement of data packets across a
network can provide an indication of how

28
00:01:39.353 --> 00:01:43.720
well the network is performing. Network
performance can be measured by bandwidth.

29
00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.790
Bandwidth refers to the amount of
data a device receives every second.

30
00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:52.106
You can calculate bandwidth by dividing
the quantity of data by the time in

31
00:01:52.106 --> 00:01:53.110
seconds.

32
00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.450
Speed refers to the rate at which data
packets are received or downloaded.

33
00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.262
Security personnel are interested
in network bandwidth and speed

34
00:02:01.262 --> 00:02:06.281
because if either are irregular,
it could be an indication of an attack.

35
00:02:06.281 --> 00:02:09.318
Packet sniffing is
the practice of capturing and

36
00:02:09.318 --> 00:02:12.230
inspecting data packets
across the network.

37
00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.832
Communication on the network is
important for sharing resources and

38
00:02:15.832 --> 00:02:19.255
data because it allows organizations
to function effectively.

39
00:02:19.255 --> 00:02:19.857
Coming up,

40
00:02:19.857 --> 00:02:23.721
you'll learn more about the protocols
to support network communication.
