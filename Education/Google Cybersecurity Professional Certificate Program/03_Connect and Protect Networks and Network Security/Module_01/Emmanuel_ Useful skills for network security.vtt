00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:06.495
My name is Emmanuel and I am

2
00:00:06.495 --> 00:00:08.535
an offensive security
engineer at Google.

3
00:00:08.535 --> 00:00:10.275
For offensive security,

4
00:00:10.275 --> 00:00:13.425
my job is to simulate
adversaries and threats

5
00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:16.725
that are targeting
various companies and I

6
00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:18.420
look at defending how

7
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.325
we can protect Google's
infrastructure.

8
00:00:20.325 --> 00:00:21.480
I make it harder to hack

9
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:22.845
Google by actually
hacking Google.

10
00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:25.635
The technical skills that I
use is a lot of programming,

11
00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:27.615
as well as learning about

12
00:00:27.615 --> 00:00:30.225
operational and
platform security.

13
00:00:30.225 --> 00:00:31.815
Knowing how these
computers work,

14
00:00:31.815 --> 00:00:33.405
what is under the hood,

15
00:00:33.405 --> 00:00:36.600
and understanding the components

16
00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.470
that create this infrastructure.

17
00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.430
An entry-level
cybersecurity analyst would

18
00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:42.560
look at using command lines,

19
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:43.700
log parsing, and
network traffic

20
00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:45.600
analysis in their
everyday scope of work.

21
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.260
Command line allows
you to interact

22
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.170
with various levels of
your operating system,

23
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.690
whether it's the
low-level things

24
00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.190
like the memory and the kernel,

25
00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.600
or if it's high-level
things like

26
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.800
the applications
and the programs

27
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.045
that you're running
on your computer.

28
00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:00.650
With log parsing,
they're going to be

29
00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:02.510
times where you
may need to figure

30
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.880
out and debug what is
going on in your program

31
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:07.280
or application and
these logs are

32
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.620
there to help you
and support you in

33
00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:12.350
finding the root issue and
then resolve it from there.

34
00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.150
With this network
traffic analysis,

35
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:15.740
there may be times where
you need to figure

36
00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.750
out why is my
Internet going slow?

37
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.310
Why is traffic not

38
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.920
being routed to the
appropriate destination?

39
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:23.360
What can I do to

40
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.610
ensure that my network
is up and running?

41
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:28.910
Network traffic analysis is
looking at network across

42
00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:31.235
various application
and network layers

43
00:01:31.235 --> 00:01:33.515
and seeing what that
traffic is doing,

44
00:01:33.515 --> 00:01:35.375
how we can secure that traffic,

45
00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:38.075
as well as identify any
vulnerabilities and concerns.

46
00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:39.770
In the contexts for
me, for security,

47
00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.900
I look at: are passwords being

48
00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.040
leaked in the traffic that's

49
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.495
being sent across the network?

50
00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:46.490
Are infrastructures
being secured?

51
00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.160
Are firewalls being readily

52
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:51.630
configured and
configured safely?

53
00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.090
One skill that
has continued to

54
00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.815
grow with me in my current role

55
00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:56.300
has been communicating
effectively

56
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.505
to product teams, engineers,

57
00:01:58.505 --> 00:02:01.940
and identifying an issue
that is influencing or

58
00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.860
affecting the business, and

59
00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:06.020
communicating to those teams
effectively to fix it.

60
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.880
Being able to take
on these many hats

61
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.000
and explain things with the
right business approach to

62
00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.400
things to ensure that
the issues that I

63
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.690
do find in my work are

64
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.160
identified but there
are also fixed.

65
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.560
My advice to folks
who are taking

66
00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:19.640
this certificate would take

67
00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.295
things apart, feel
uncomfortable,

68
00:02:22.295 --> 00:02:24.320
learn and grow and find

69
00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:27.350
opportunities to learn
and understand how

70
00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.825
things work and
that skill set will

71
00:02:29.825 --> 00:02:33.690
benefit you for the
remainder of your journey.
