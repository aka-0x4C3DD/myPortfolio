00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.000
Now that we've discussed
the structure of

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.640
a network and how
communications takes place,

3
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:07.320
it's important for
you to know how

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.090
the security
professionals identify

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.800
problems that might arise.

6
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.740
The TCP/IP model is a
framework that is used to

7
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.030
visualize how data is

8
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.820
organized and transmitted
across the network.

9
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:20.940
The TCP/IP model
has four layers.

10
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.640
The four layers are: the
network access layer,

11
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:26.310
the internet layer,
the transport layer,

12
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:27.900
and the application layer.

13
00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:31.305
Knowing how the TCP/IP model
organizes network activity

14
00:00:31.305 --> 00:00:32.760
allows security professionals to

15
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:35.220
monitor and secure
against risks.

16
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:37.820
Let's examine these
layers one at a time.

17
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.595
Layer one is the
network access layer.

18
00:00:40.595 --> 00:00:43.010
The network access layer
deals with creation of

19
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.680
data packets and their
transmission across a network.

20
00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:47.780
This includes hardware
devices connected to

21
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.520
physical cables and switches

22
00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:51.790
that direct data
to its destination.

23
00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:54.210
Layer two is the internet layer.

24
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:56.930
The internet layer is where
IP addresses are attached to

25
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.160
data packets to indicate

26
00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:00.485
the location of the
sender and receiver.

27
00:01:00.485 --> 00:01:02.510
The internet layer also focuses

28
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.705
on how networks
connect to each other.

29
00:01:04.705 --> 00:01:06.740
For example, data packets

30
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:08.600
containing information
that determine whether

31
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.400
they will stay on the
LAN or will be sent

32
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.860
to a remote network,
like the internet.

33
00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.590
The transport layer
includes protocols to

34
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.410
control the flow of
traffic across a network.

35
00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.560
These protocols permit or
deny communication with

36
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.270
other devices and include

37
00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:25.600
information about the
status of the connection.

38
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.085
Activities of this layer
include error control,

39
00:01:28.085 --> 00:01:29.360
which ensures data is flowing

40
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.265
smoothly across the network.

41
00:01:32.265 --> 00:01:33.890
Finally, at the
application layer,

42
00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:35.840
protocols determine
how the data packets

43
00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:38.345
will interact with
receiving devices.

44
00:01:38.345 --> 00:01:41.090
Functions that are organized
at application layer

45
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.360
include file transfers
and email services.

46
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.070
Now you have an understanding of

47
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.810
the TCP/IP model and its

48
00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:51.120
four layers. Meet you
in the next video.
