00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.675
Hello again. In this video,

2
00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:05.910
you'll learn more about
communication protocols and

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.200
devices used to communicate

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.730
with each other
across the internet.

5
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.355
This is called the TCP/IP model.

6
00:00:12.355 --> 00:00:13.170
TCP/IP stands for

7
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.425
Transmission Control Protocol
and Internet Protocol.

8
00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:18.330
TCP/IP is the standard model

9
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.185
used for network communication.

10
00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:22.520
Let's take a closer
look at this model by

11
00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.115
defining TCP and IP separately.

12
00:00:26.115 --> 00:00:28.535
First, TCP, or Transmission
Control Protocol,

13
00:00:28.535 --> 00:00:30.920
is an internet communication
protocol that allows

14
00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.910
two devices to form a
connection and stream data.

15
00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.080
The protocol includes a
set of instructions to

16
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.555
organize data, so it can
be sent across a network.

17
00:00:38.555 --> 00:00:41.420
It also establishes a
connection between two devices

18
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.740
and makes sure that packets

19
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.825
reach their appropriate
destination.

20
00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:48.705
The IP in TCP/IP stands
for Internet Protocol.

21
00:00:48.705 --> 00:00:51.440
IP has a set of standards used
for routing and addressing

22
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.700
data packets as they travel

23
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.325
between devices on a network.

24
00:00:54.325 --> 00:00:57.170
Included in the Internet
Protocol (IP) is the IP address

25
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.910
that functions as an address
for each private network.

26
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.835
You'll learn more about
IP addresses a bit later.

27
00:01:03.835 --> 00:01:06.160
When data packets are sent and
received across a network,

28
00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.780
they are assigned a port.

29
00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.705
Within the operating system
of a network device,

30
00:01:10.705 --> 00:01:13.959
a port is a software-based
location that organizes

31
00:01:13.959 --> 00:01:15.580
the sending and receiving of data

32
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.890
between devices
on a network.

33
00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:20.800
Ports divide network
traffic into segments

34
00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:22.060
based on the service they will perform

35
00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:24.040
between two devices.

36
00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.600
The computers sending and

37
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:27.550
receiving these data
segments know how to

38
00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.295
prioritize and process
these segments

39
00:01:30.295 --> 00:01:31.960
based on their port number.

40
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:33.580
This is like sending a letter to

41
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:35.440
a friend who lives in
an apartment building.

42
00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.210
The mail delivery person

43
00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:39.700
not only knows how to
find the building,

44
00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.370
but they also know exactly
where to go in the building

45
00:01:42.370 --> 00:01:45.100
to find the apartment number
where your friend lives.

46
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:47.240
Data packets include
instructions that tell

47
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:50.020
the receiving device what
to do with the information.

48
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.820
These instructions come in
the form of a port number.

49
00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.680
Port numbers allow computers

50
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.000
to split the network traffic and

51
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.890
prioritize the operations they

52
00:01:57.890 --> 00:01:59.405
will perform with the data.

53
00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:01.270
Some common port
numbers are:

54
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.485
port 25, which is used for e-mail,

55
00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:05.150
port 443, which is

56
00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:07.160
used for secure internet
communication,

57
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.905
and port 20, for large
file transfers.

58
00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:11.345
As you've learned in this video,

59
00:02:11.345 --> 00:02:13.190
a lot of information
and instructions are

60
00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.540
contained in data packets as

61
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.100
they travel across a network.

62
00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:20.280
Coming up, you'll learn more
about the TCP/IP model.
