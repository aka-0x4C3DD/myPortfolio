00:00:03.650 --> 00:00:08.190
My name is Tina and I'm a
software engineer at Google.

2
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.570
As a software engineer,

3
00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.405
I work on an internal tool

4
00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:15.630
that serves the
security engineers

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.040
and network engineers at Google.

6
00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.560
Network security is
important because we

7
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.320
want to make sure that
our network systems are

8
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.870
safe and resilient to be able

9
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.860
to defend against
malicious hackers,

10
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.330
and that we have the ability
to protect our user data.

11
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:34.700
Working with network
security allows to see

12
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.730
the overview of the whole
company's network systems,

13
00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.115
which is super cool.

14
00:00:39.115 --> 00:00:42.590
My favorite part of my
job is the impact I get

15
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.205
to have on the community
that I serve at Google.

16
00:00:46.205 --> 00:00:50.275
I would say most of my day
is a lot of coding, design,

17
00:00:50.275 --> 00:00:55.010
talking to security teams
and network teams on

18
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.920
their priorities
and their blockers

19
00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:00.770
and being able to come
up with a solution.

20
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:03.850
There are often going to be

21
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:07.730
requests that come
from network teams and

22
00:01:07.730 --> 00:01:11.915
security teams that have
specific requirements on

23
00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:14.180
certain platforms or on

24
00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.300
a feature that they need in
one of the network policies,

25
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.135
and usually we
would escalate that

26
00:01:20.135 --> 00:01:24.245
and try to work on
a fix for that.

27
00:01:24.245 --> 00:01:26.540
One piece of advice I would give

28
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:29.060
for someone who wants to take on

29
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:32.270
the cybersecurity
journey is to be able to

30
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:33.770
always keep learning and be

31
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.245
curious about how things work.

32
00:01:36.245 --> 00:01:41.300
Because security is an
ever changing field,

33
00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.715
cybersecurity is
definitely a team sport.

34
00:01:43.715 --> 00:01:46.650
Everybody has something
to contribute,

35
00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:50.965
and especially on
cybersecurity problems,

36
00:01:50.965 --> 00:01:53.960
there can be a lot
of possibilities

37
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.960
and a lot of different
solutions to one problem.

38
00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.990
It's always great to be able

39
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.975
to have people to
brainstorm with and to

40
00:02:02.975 --> 00:02:05.870
track down issues
together because things

41
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.930
can get very complex sometimes,

42
00:02:08.930 --> 00:02:11.420
but it's also a
fun process to be

43
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:14.850
able to work on things together.
