00:00:00.807 --> 00:00:04.200
Companies have traditionally
owned their network devices, and

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:06.447
kept them in their own office buildings.

3
00:00:06.447 --> 00:00:11.280
But now, a lot of companies are using third-party
providers to manage their networks.

4
00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:12.408
Why?

5
00:00:12.408 --> 00:00:16.394
Well, this model helps companies save
money while giving them access to more network

6
00:00:16.394 --> 00:00:17.510
resources.

7
00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.566
The growth of cloud computing is
helping many companies reduce costs and

8
00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:23.835
streamline their network operations.

9
00:00:24.835 --> 00:00:29.098
Cloud computing is the practice of using
remote servers, applications, and network

10
00:00:29.098 --> 00:00:33.939
services that are hosted on the internet
instead of on local physical devices.

11
00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:38.291
Today, the number of businesses that use
cloud computing is increasing every year,

12
00:00:38.291 --> 00:00:43.313
so it's important to understand how cloud
networks function and how to secure them.

13
00:00:44.313 --> 00:00:47.606
Cloud providers offer an alternative
to traditional on-premise networks, and

14
00:00:47.606 --> 00:00:52.162
allow organizations to have the benefits
of the traditional network without storing

15
00:00:52.162 --> 00:00:54.949
the devices and managing
the network on their own.

16
00:00:55.949 --> 00:01:00.117
A cloud network is a collection of servers
or computers that stores resources and

17
00:01:00.117 --> 00:01:04.308
data in a remote data center that
can be accessed via the internet.

18
00:01:04.308 --> 00:01:07.979
Because companies don't house
the servers at their physical location,

19
00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.593
these servers are referred
to as being "in the cloud".

20
00:01:11.593 --> 00:01:14.835
Traditional networks host web servers from
a business in its physical location.

21
00:01:14.835 --> 00:01:19.644
However, cloud networks are different from
traditional networks because they use remote servers,

22
00:01:19.644 --> 00:01:22.420
which
allow online services and web applications

23
00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.819
to be used
from any geographic location.

24
00:01:25.819 --> 00:01:30.507
Cloud security will become increasingly
relevant to many security professionals as

25
00:01:30.507 --> 00:01:33.185
more organizations migrate
to cloud services.

26
00:01:34.185 --> 00:01:37.576
Cloud service providers offer cloud
computing to maintain applications.

27
00:01:37.576 --> 00:01:40.406
For example,
they provide on-demand storage and

28
00:01:40.406 --> 00:01:43.709
processing power that their
customers only pay as needed.

29
00:01:43.709 --> 00:01:45.492
They also provide business and

30
00:01:45.492 --> 00:01:50.233
web analytics that organizations can use
to monitor their web traffic and sales.

31
00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:54.308
With the transition to cloud networking,
I have witnessed an overlap of identity-based

32
00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:57.921
security on top of the more
traditional network-based solutions.

33
00:01:57.921 --> 00:02:01.997
This meant that my focus needed to be
on verifying both where the traffic is coming from

34
00:02:01.997 --> 00:02:04.903
and
the identity that is coming with it.

35
00:02:05.903 --> 00:02:08.868
More organizations are moving their network
services to the cloud to save money and simplify

36
00:02:08.868 --> 00:02:10.354
their operations.

37
00:02:10.354 --> 00:02:11.688
As this trend has grown,

38
00:02:11.688 --> 00:02:15.446
cloud security has become a significant
aspect of network security.
