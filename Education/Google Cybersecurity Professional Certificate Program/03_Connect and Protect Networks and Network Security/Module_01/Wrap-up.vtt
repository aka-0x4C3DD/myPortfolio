00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.517
Hey, you made it!

2
00:00:01.517 --> 00:00:03.028
Well done!

3
00:00:03.028 --> 00:00:05.913
Let's wrap up what you've learned
in this section of the course.

4
00:00:06.913 --> 00:00:09.405
We explored the structure of a network,
including WANs and LANs.

5
00:00:09.405 --> 00:00:13.894
We also discussed standard
networking tools like hubs, switches,

6
00:00:13.894 --> 00:00:15.248
routers, and modems.

7
00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:19.185
We briefly introduced cloud networks, and
we discussed their benefits.

8
00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.081
We also spent some time
on the TCP/IP model.

9
00:00:22.081 --> 00:00:26.437
As a reminder, technicians and security
analysts often use this framework when

10
00:00:26.437 --> 00:00:29.543
communicating where network
problems have occurred.

11
00:00:30.543 --> 00:00:31.246
That wraps up this section.

12
00:00:31.246 --> 00:00:33.989
Next, you'll learn more
about network operations and

13
00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.451
how data is transmitted
over wireless networks.
