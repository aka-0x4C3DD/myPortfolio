00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:06.570
My name is Chris and I'm

2
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:09.620
the Chief Information Security
Officer at Google Fiber.

3
00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.340
We provide high speed Internet

4
00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.575
to customers across
the United States.

5
00:00:13.575 --> 00:00:16.020
As the chief information
security officer,

6
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.550
I'm responsible for making

7
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.350
sure that the
network stays safe,

8
00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.425
our customers' data
stays safe and that we

9
00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.815
are supporting law enforcement
and others as required.

10
00:00:25.815 --> 00:00:30.120
The career path was a
long and winding one.

11
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:32.685
My actual first
job was working as

12
00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:35.400
a butcher at the
family grocery store.

13
00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:37.470
I eventually ended up with

14
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:40.585
a job in the computer
center at college,

15
00:00:40.585 --> 00:00:42.140
which is where I learned

16
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.195
a lot of my initial
computer skills.

17
00:00:44.195 --> 00:00:46.145
Then when I graduated
from college,

18
00:00:46.145 --> 00:00:48.589
I started off as a
software developer,

19
00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:51.380
designing accounting
software for

20
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:52.700
a consulting company supporting

21
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.230
the Department of Agriculture.

22
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.065
Then I moved on from
that to other roles,

23
00:00:57.065 --> 00:00:58.880
eventually ending up in one of

24
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:01.835
the first Internet
over cable companies.

25
00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:05.090
I ran several of their services,

26
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.825
email, web services, etc.

27
00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:09.990
My stuff kept getting attacked.

28
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.080
I fell into cybersecurity

29
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:14.780
because I had to defend the
things that I was building.

30
00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.370
I realized it was fun.

31
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.910
I realized that it was a
great career opportunity.

32
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.795
I've just stuck with
that ever since then.

33
00:01:22.795 --> 00:01:24.545
When I got into this field,

34
00:01:24.545 --> 00:01:25.895
other than a couple of books,

35
00:01:25.895 --> 00:01:28.145
there wasn't a lot of
training material out there.

36
00:01:28.145 --> 00:01:30.920
There were some other
people out there that I

37
00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.830
could ask questions of,
and I could get some mentoring from.

38
00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:38.635
But as a general rule of
thumb, I was on my own.

39
00:01:38.635 --> 00:01:41.780
Despite this being a
fairly technical field,

40
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.000
the most important
thing you're going to

41
00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.200
learn are the connections

42
00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.825
you're going to make
to other people.

43
00:01:46.825 --> 00:01:50.210
I made a conscious decision
to become actively

44
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.750
involved in some of the
outside work organizations,

45
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.810
the trade associations,
the non profits,

46
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.640
the meet ups,

47
00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.920
and other cybersecurity
organizations.

48
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.460
This enabled me to build
the reputation and

49
00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:08.195
the relationships so that
as my career moved along,

50
00:02:08.195 --> 00:02:10.580
people were reaching out
to me saying, hey Chris,

51
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.010
we have this opportunity,
are you interested?

52
00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:16.065
Because the cybersecurity
industry is so varied,

53
00:02:16.065 --> 00:02:17.435
it can seem like there is

54
00:02:17.435 --> 00:02:20.330
a tremendous amount you
have to learn that there is

55
00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.670
this huge step that you have

56
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.355
to take in order to
get into the industry.

57
00:02:25.355 --> 00:02:27.955
That can be daunting.

58
00:02:27.955 --> 00:02:30.780
But the thing to remember is,

59
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.950
once you have that
fundamental level

60
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.440
of skills and fundamental
level of background,

61
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.270
there are so many different
directions you can

62
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:40.805
go and there's so much
opportunity out there.

63
00:02:40.805 --> 00:02:43.790
There's this continuous
education and

64
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.315
curiosity aspect of the
job that is so much fun.

65
00:02:47.315 --> 00:02:49.700
It means that you are always

66
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.010
having the opportunity
to learn something new,

67
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.030
to change directions and
go in new ways because

68
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.770
cybersecurity is going to be

69
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:01.260
constantly changing.
And that's part of the fun.
