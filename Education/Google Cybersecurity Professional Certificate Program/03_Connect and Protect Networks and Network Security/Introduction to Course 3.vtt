00:00:00.955 --> 00:00:03.957
You've learned about security domains in
previous courses.

2
00:00:03.957 --> 00:00:07.846
Now we'll explore one of those
domains further: networks.

3
00:00:07.846 --> 00:00:12.421
It's important to secure networks because
network-based attacks are growing in both

4
00:00:12.421 --> 00:00:13.952
frequency and complexity.

5
00:00:15.952 --> 00:00:18.660
Hi there! My name is Chris, and I'm
the Chief Information Security Officer for

6
00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.597
Google Fiber.

7
00:00:19.597 --> 00:00:22.120
I'm excited to be your instructor for
this course!

8
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:26.369
I've been working in network security and
engineering for over 20 years, and

9
00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:30.505
I'm looking forward to sharing some of
my knowledge and experience with you.

10
00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:34.640
This course will help you understand
the basic structure of a network (also

11
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.661
referred to as network architecture)
and commonly used network tools.

12
00:00:38.661 --> 00:00:43.083
You'll also learn about network operations
and explore some basic network protocols.

13
00:00:43.083 --> 00:00:46.096
Next, you'll learn about
common network attacks and

14
00:00:46.096 --> 00:00:49.706
how network intrusion tactics can
prevent a threat to a network.

15
00:00:49.706 --> 00:00:53.906
Finally, the course will provide an
overview of security hardening practices

16
00:00:53.906 --> 00:00:56.620
and how you might use them
to help secure a network.

17
00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.121
There's a lot to learn in
securing networks, and

18
00:00:59.121 --> 00:01:01.333
I'm excited to go on
this journey with you.

19
00:01:01.333 --> 00:01:02.387
Ready to get started?

20
00:01:02.387 --> 00:01:03.273
Let's go!
