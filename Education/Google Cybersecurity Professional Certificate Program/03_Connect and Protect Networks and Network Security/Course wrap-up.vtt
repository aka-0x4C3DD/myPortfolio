00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.831
Wow, we have covered a lot in this course!

2
00:00:04.831 --> 00:00:07.189
Let's review everything we've discussed.

3
00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:12.188
You learned about networks, network
architecture, and the best practices used

4
00:00:12.188 --> 00:00:16.837
by security professionals to secure
a network against security breaches.

5
00:00:16.837 --> 00:00:18.751
As we bring this course to a close,

6
00:00:18.751 --> 00:00:22.579
let's review what you've learned
about security networks so far.

7
00:00:23.579 --> 00:00:25.780
First, we explored
the structure of a network.

8
00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:29.792
A security analyst must understand how
a network is designed to be able to

9
00:00:29.792 --> 00:00:34.348
identify parts of a network that present
vulnerabilities and need to be secured.

10
00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:37.636
Next, we learned about
network operations and

11
00:00:37.636 --> 00:00:40.684
how they affect the communication of data.

12
00:00:40.684 --> 00:00:44.973
Network protocols determine how the data
is transmitted over the network.

13
00:00:44.973 --> 00:00:49.848
As communication takes place over the
network, malicious actors may use tactics

14
00:00:49.848 --> 00:00:54.169
such as denial of service attacks,
packet sniffing, and IP spoofing.

15
00:00:54.169 --> 00:00:56.320
Security analysts employ tools and

16
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.414
measures such as firewall rules
to protect against these attacks.

17
00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:02.941
We also discussed security hardening.

18
00:01:02.941 --> 00:01:06.688
Security hardening is used to reduce
the attack area of a network.

19
00:01:06.688 --> 00:01:10.129
This means the attack does not
disable an entire network.

20
00:01:10.129 --> 00:01:14.689
Security hardening can be done at
the hardware level, the software level, or

21
00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:15.874
the network level.

22
00:01:15.874 --> 00:01:20.149
Securing networks is an essential
part of a security analyst's duties.

23
00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:24.784
Knowledge of a network and its operations
and security practices will ensure that

24
00:01:24.784 --> 00:01:28.018
you are successful in your
career as a security analyst.

25
00:01:29.018 --> 00:01:31.069
And that brings us to
the topic of our next course,

26
00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:34.712
which will cover computing basics for
security analysts.

27
00:01:34.712 --> 00:01:39.656
In that course, you'll learn how to use
the Linux command line to authenticate and

28
00:01:39.656 --> 00:01:42.411
authorize users on the network, and
to use S-Q-L,

29
00:01:42.411 --> 00:01:45.887
otherwise known as SQL,
to communicate with databases.

30
00:01:45.887 --> 00:01:48.223
Great work getting here!

31
00:01:48.223 --> 00:01:51.975
All of the concepts you've learned in
this section will be essential for

32
00:01:51.975 --> 00:01:54.200
success in your role as security analyst.

33
00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.688
Now you can move on to the next course.
Enjoy!
