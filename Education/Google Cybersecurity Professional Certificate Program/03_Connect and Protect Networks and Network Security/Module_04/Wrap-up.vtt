00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.870
Great work on learning
about security hardening!

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.250
Let's take a few minutes to
wrap up what you've learned.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.360
You learned about
security hardening and

4
00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.060
its importance to an
organization's infrastructure.

5
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.680
First, we discussed how

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.050
security hardening
strengthens systems and

7
00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.795
networks to reduce the
likelihood of an attack.

8
00:00:18.795 --> 00:00:22.455
Next, we covered the
importance of OS hardening,

9
00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:25.785
including patch updates,
baseline configurations,

10
00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:28.315
and hardware and
software disposal.

11
00:00:28.315 --> 00:00:31.460
Then we explored network
hardening practices, such as

12
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.880
network log analysis and
firewall rule maintenance.

13
00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.025
Finally, we examined cloud

14
00:00:37.025 --> 00:00:39.050
network hardening and
the responsibilities of

15
00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:40.760
both organizations and

16
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.685
cloud service providers
in maintaining security.

17
00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:45.470
As a security analyst,

18
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.465
you'll be working with
operating systems,

19
00:00:47.465 --> 00:00:50.120
on-premise networks,
and cloud networks.

20
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.820
You'll be using all the
knowledge that we learned in

21
00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.550
this section in your career
as a security analyst.
