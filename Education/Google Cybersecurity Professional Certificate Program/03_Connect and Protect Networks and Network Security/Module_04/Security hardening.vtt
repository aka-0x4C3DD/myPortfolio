00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.705
Security analysts and the organizations
they work with have to be

2
00:00:04.705 --> 00:00:07.820
proactive about protecting
systems from attack.

3
00:00:07.820 --> 00:00:10.487
This is where security hardening comes in.

4
00:00:10.487 --> 00:00:15.013
Security hardening is the process of
strengthening a system to reduce its

5
00:00:15.013 --> 00:00:17.290
vulnerability and attack surface.

6
00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:21.744
All the potential vulnerabilities
that a threat actor could exploit

7
00:00:21.744 --> 00:00:24.671
are referred to as
a system's attack surface.

8
00:00:25.671 --> 00:00:29.020
Let's use an example that
compares a network to a house.

9
00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.316
The attack surface would
be all the doors and

10
00:00:31.316 --> 00:00:34.500
windows that a robber could use
to gain access to that house.

11
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.650
Just like putting locks on all
the doors and windows in the house,

12
00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.414
security hardening involves
minimizing the attack surface or

13
00:00:41.414 --> 00:00:45.827
potential vulnerabilities and
keeping a network as secure as possible.

14
00:00:46.827 --> 00:00:50.608
As part of security hardening, security
analysts perform regular maintenance

15
00:00:50.608 --> 00:00:54.967
procedures to keep network devices and
systems functioning securely and

16
00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:56.200
optimally.

17
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.396
Security hardening can be
conducted on any device or

18
00:00:59.396 --> 00:01:03.752
system that can be compromised,
such as hardware, operating systems,

19
00:01:03.752 --> 00:01:07.550
applications, computer networks, and
databases.

20
00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.640
Physical security is also
a part of security hardening.

21
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.300
This may include securing a physical space
with security cameras and security guards.

22
00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.672
Some common types of hardening
procedures include software updates,

23
00:01:19.672 --> 00:01:24.890
also called patches, and
device application configuration changes.

24
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.362
These updates and
changes are done to increase security and

25
00:01:28.362 --> 00:01:31.020
fix security vulnerabilities on a network.

26
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.870
An example of a security configuration
change would be requiring longer

27
00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.960
passwords or
more frequent password changes.

28
00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.320
This makes it harder for a malicious
actor to gain login credentials.

29
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:46.725
An example of a configuration check is
updating the encryption standards for

30
00:01:46.725 --> 00:01:49.310
data that is stored in a database.

31
00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:51.537
Keeping encryption up to
date makes it harder for

32
00:01:51.537 --> 00:01:53.510
malicious actors to access the database.

33
00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:56.713
Other examples of security
hardening include removing or

34
00:01:56.713 --> 00:02:00.962
disabling unused applications and
services, disabling unused ports, and

35
00:02:00.962 --> 00:02:04.270
reducing access permissions
across devices and network.

36
00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:08.830
Minimizing the number of applications,
devices, ports, and access permissions

37
00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.263
makes network and device monitoring more
efficient and reduces the overall attack

38
00:02:13.263 --> 00:02:17.170
surface, which is one of the best
ways to secure an organization.

39
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:18.880
Another important strategy for

40
00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.380
security hardening is to conduct
regular penetration testing.

41
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:28.045
A penetration test, also called a pen test,
is a simulated attack that helps identify

42
00:02:28.045 --> 00:02:33.561
vulnerabilities in a system, network,
website, application, and process.

43
00:02:33.561 --> 00:02:38.170
Penetration testers document
their findings in a report.

44
00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:42.369
Depending on where the test fails,
security teams can determine the type of

45
00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:45.138
security vulnerabilities
that require fixing.

46
00:02:45.138 --> 00:02:48.360
Organizations can then review
these vulnerabilities and

47
00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:50.075
come up with a plan to fix them.

48
00:02:51.075 --> 00:02:54.471
Coming up, you'll learn more about how
security hardening is an essential aspect

49
00:02:54.471 --> 00:02:55.750
of securing networks.

50
00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.124
It's a foundational part of
network security that strengthens

51
00:02:59.124 --> 00:03:02.570
the network in order to reduce
the number of successful attacks.
