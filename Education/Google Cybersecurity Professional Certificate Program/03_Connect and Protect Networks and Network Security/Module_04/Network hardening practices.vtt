00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.200
Earlier, you learned that
OS hardening focuses

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.170
on device safety and
uses patch updates,

3
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:10.980
secure configuration, and
account access policies.

4
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.635
Now we'll focus on
network hardening.

5
00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:15.180
Network hardening focuses

6
00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.070
on network-related
security hardening,

7
00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:20.340
like port filtering,
network access privileges,

8
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.575
and encryption over networks.

9
00:00:22.575 --> 00:00:25.800
Certain network hardening
tasks are performed regularly,

10
00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.060
while others are performed

11
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.250
once and then updated as needed.

12
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:30.750
Some tasks that are regularly

13
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:33.140
performed are firewall
rules maintenance,

14
00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:38.360
network log analysis, patch
updates, and server backups.

15
00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.600
Earlier, you learned that
a log is a record of

16
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.545
events that occurs within
an organization's systems.

17
00:00:44.545 --> 00:00:48.050
Network log analysis
is the process of

18
00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:52.175
examining network logs to
identify events of interest.

19
00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:55.730
Security teams use
a log analyzer tool

20
00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:59.645
or a security information
and event management tool,

21
00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:01.670
also known as a SIEM,

22
00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.160
to conduct network log analysis.

23
00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.850
A SIEM tool is an application
that collects and analyzes

24
00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:09.110
log data to monitor

25
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.800
critical activities
in an organization.

26
00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:14.380
It gathers security
data from a network and

27
00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.065
presents that data on
a single dashboard.

28
00:01:17.065 --> 00:01:18.970
The dashboard
interface is sometimes

29
00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:21.255
called a single pane of glass.

30
00:01:21.255 --> 00:01:25.075
A SIEM helps analysts
to inspect, analyze,

31
00:01:25.075 --> 00:01:26.920
and react to security events

32
00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.825
across the network based
on their priority.

33
00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:31.870
Reports from the SIEM
provide a list of

34
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:34.435
new or ongoing network
vulnerabilities

35
00:01:34.435 --> 00:01:36.040
and list them on a scale

36
00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:38.200
of priority from high to

37
00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.870
low, where high priority
vulnerabilities

38
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:43.675
have a much shorter
deadline for mitigation.

39
00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:45.430
Now that we've covered tasks

40
00:01:45.430 --> 00:01:46.540
that are performed regularly,

41
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.405
let's examine tasks that
are performed once.

42
00:01:49.405 --> 00:01:52.479
These tasks include port
filtering on firewalls,

43
00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:54.410
network access privileges, and

44
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.425
encryption for communication,
among many things.

45
00:01:57.425 --> 00:01:59.135
Let's start with port filtering.

46
00:01:59.135 --> 00:02:01.760
Port filtering can be
formed over the network.

47
00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.240
Port filtering is a firewall
function that blocks or

48
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:06.905
allows certain port numbers

49
00:02:06.905 --> 00:02:09.215
to limit unwanted communication.

50
00:02:09.215 --> 00:02:11.120
A basic principle is that

51
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.350
the only ports that are

52
00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:14.455
needed are the ones
that are allowed.

53
00:02:14.455 --> 00:02:16.430
Any port that isn't
being used by

54
00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.735
the normal network operations
should be disallowed.

55
00:02:19.735 --> 00:02:22.755
This protects against
port vulnerabilities.

56
00:02:22.755 --> 00:02:24.590
Networks should be set up with

57
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.450
the most up-to-date
wireless protocols

58
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.605
available and

59
00:02:27.605 --> 00:02:30.380
older wireless protocols
should be disabled.

60
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.570
Security analysts also use

61
00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:35.000
network segmentation to create

62
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.650
isolated subnets for

63
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.690
different departments
in an organization.

64
00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:40.940
For example, they
might make one for

65
00:02:40.940 --> 00:02:42.170
the marketing department and

66
00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:43.730
one for the finance department.

67
00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.800
This is done so the issues in

68
00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.085
each subnet don't spread
across the whole company and

69
00:02:49.085 --> 00:02:51.680
only specified users
are given access to

70
00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:55.060
the part of the network that
they require for their role.

71
00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:57.560
Network segmentation
may also be used

72
00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.065
to separate different
security zones.

73
00:03:00.065 --> 00:03:03.080
Any restricted zone on
a network containing

74
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.555
highly classified or
confidential data

75
00:03:05.555 --> 00:03:07.925
should be separate from
the rest of the network.

76
00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:11.030
Lastly, all network
communication should be

77
00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.420
encrypted using the latest
encryption standards.

78
00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.960
Encryption standards are
rules or methods used to

79
00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:19.895
conceal outgoing data and

80
00:03:19.895 --> 00:03:22.850
uncover or decrypt
incoming data.

81
00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:25.130
Data in restricted zones should

82
00:03:25.130 --> 00:03:27.155
have much higher
encryption standards,

83
00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:29.719
which makes them more
difficult to access.

84
00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:32.810
You've learned about the most
common hardening practices.

85
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:34.700
This knowledge will be
useful as you complete

86
00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.260
the certificate program and it's

87
00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:39.930
essential to your career
as a security analyst.
