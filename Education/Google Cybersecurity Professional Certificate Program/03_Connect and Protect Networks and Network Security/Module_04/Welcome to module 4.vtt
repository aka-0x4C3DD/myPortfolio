00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.240
I want to take a moment to congratulate
you on your progress so far.

2
00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:08.850
First, you learned about
network operations.

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.115
Then, you learned about the tools and

4
00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:14.840
protocols that help
network systems function.

5
00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.454
Next, you learned how vulnerabilities in

6
00:00:17.454 --> 00:00:21.110
networks expose them to
various security intrusions.

7
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:24.140
Now, we'll discuss security hardening.

8
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:28.641
Then, we'll learn about OS hardening,
explore network hardening practices, and

9
00:00:28.641 --> 00:00:30.750
discuss cloud hardening practices.

10
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:34.802
Security hardening can be
implemented in devices, networks,

11
00:00:34.802 --> 00:00:38.080
applications, and cloud infrastructure.

12
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.292
Security analysts may perform
tasks, such as patch updates and

13
00:00:42.292 --> 00:00:45.050
backups, as part of security hardening.

14
00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:48.415
We'll discuss these tasks as you
progress through the course.

15
00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:53.622
As a security analyst, hardening will play
a major role in your day-to-day tasks,

16
00:00:53.622 --> 00:00:57.777
which is why it's important for
you to understand how it works.

17
00:00:57.777 --> 00:01:00.430
I'm excited to accompany
you on this journey.

18
00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:01.650
Meet you in the next video.
