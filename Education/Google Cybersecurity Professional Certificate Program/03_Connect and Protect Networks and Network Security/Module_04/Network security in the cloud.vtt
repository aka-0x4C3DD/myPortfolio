00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.340
In recent years, many organizations
are using network services in the cloud.

2
00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:09.270
So in addition to securing
on-premises networks,

3
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.406
a security analyst will need
to secure cloud networks.

4
00:00:12.406 --> 00:00:16.546
In a previous video, you learned that
a cloud network is a collection of

5
00:00:16.546 --> 00:00:19.354
servers or
computers that stores resources and

6
00:00:19.354 --> 00:00:23.600
data in a remote data center that
can be accessed via the internet.

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.894
They can host company data and
applications using cloud computing to

8
00:00:27.894 --> 00:00:32.125
provide on-demand storage,
processing power, and data analytics.

9
00:00:32.125 --> 00:00:36.979
Just like regular web servers, cloud
servers also require proper maintenance

10
00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:40.400
done through various security
hardening procedures.

11
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:43.882
Although cloud servers are hosted
by a cloud service provider,

12
00:00:43.882 --> 00:00:47.053
these providers cannot prevent
intrusions in the

13
00:00:47.053 --> 00:00:51.485
cloudâ€”especially intrusions from
malicious actors, both internal and

14
00:00:51.485 --> 00:00:53.970
external to an organization.

15
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.105
One distinction between
cloud network hardening and

16
00:00:57.105 --> 00:01:01.283
traditional network hardening is
the use of a server baseline image for

17
00:01:01.283 --> 00:01:04.050
all server instances stored in the cloud.

18
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:08.362
This allows you to compare data in
the cloud servers to the baseline image to

19
00:01:08.362 --> 00:01:11.587
make sure there haven't been
any unverified changes.

20
00:01:11.587 --> 00:01:15.910
An unverified change could come from
an intrusion in the cloud network.

21
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:20.667
Similar to OS hardening, data and
applications on a cloud network are kept

22
00:01:20.667 --> 00:01:23.772
separate depending on
their service category.

23
00:01:23.772 --> 00:01:29.817
For example, older applications should be
kept separate from newer applications,

24
00:01:29.817 --> 00:01:34.544
and software that deals with internal
functions should be kept separate

25
00:01:34.544 --> 00:01:37.576
from front-end applications seen by users.

26
00:01:38.576 --> 00:01:41.641
Even though the cloud service provider
has a shared responsibility with

27
00:01:41.641 --> 00:01:46.171
the organization using their services,
there are still security measures that

28
00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:50.930
need to be taken by the organization to
make sure their cloud network is safe.

29
00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:56.640
Just like traditional networks, operations
in the cloud need to be secured.

30
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.071
