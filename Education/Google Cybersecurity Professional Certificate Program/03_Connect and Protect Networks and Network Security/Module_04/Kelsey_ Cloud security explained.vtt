2
00:00:04.353 --> 00:00:07.230
I'm Kelsey, I'm a distinguished
engineer at Google Cloud.

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.320
I work on compute platforms and
security related topics.

4
00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:14.865
When I was starting,
the only jobs I had previous,

5
00:00:14.865 --> 00:00:19.818
the only jobs I was confident were
accessible to me were fast food jobs.

6
00:00:19.818 --> 00:00:22.940
I wanted a career,
I wanted more than just a job.

7
00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:27.682
So when I zoomed out and asked myself,
what were my career options?

8
00:00:27.682 --> 00:00:32.656
I couldn't think of a better place in
the year 1999 than going into the world

9
00:00:32.656 --> 00:00:33.853
of technologies.

10
00:00:33.853 --> 00:00:38.627
I mean, on the news people were lining
up for the latest operating system.

11
00:00:38.627 --> 00:00:41.557
All the tech people were
the new rock stars.

12
00:00:41.557 --> 00:00:44.889
And I remember flipping
through the opening jobs or

13
00:00:44.889 --> 00:00:49.770
the job openings in the classified
section, and it said anyone that has one

14
00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:53.742
of these certifications let
us know because we're hiring.

15
00:00:53.742 --> 00:00:56.786
The delta between getting started and

16
00:00:56.786 --> 00:01:01.731
getting your first job into that
career that I always wanted,

17
00:01:01.731 --> 00:01:05.265
it was $35 away in a certification book.

18
00:01:05.265 --> 00:01:06.526
So let's talk about Cloud.

19
00:01:06.526 --> 00:01:11.259
So before the time of Cloud,
most companies had their own data center.

20
00:01:11.259 --> 00:01:16.808
Imagine it's just you alone in your house,
you can put anything wherever you want.

21
00:01:16.808 --> 00:01:22.298
You may choose to never lock the doors
on the inside, it's just you.

22
00:01:22.298 --> 00:01:24.292
And for a long time in our industry,

23
00:01:24.292 --> 00:01:26.964
that's the way people
ran their data centers.

24
00:01:26.964 --> 00:01:30.780
Now, we just call that private Cloud,
it's just you there.

25
00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.964
But Cloud is public.

26
00:01:32.964 --> 00:01:36.677
And so the analogy would be,
imagine getting roommates,

27
00:01:36.677 --> 00:01:40.100
now you start to think
differently about your stuff.

28
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:44.944
You start to lock things up even
while you're inside of the house, and

29
00:01:44.944 --> 00:01:48.734
your security discipline is
going to be very different.

30
00:01:48.734 --> 00:01:51.457
As more and
more companies move into Cloud.

31
00:01:51.457 --> 00:01:56.183
You may just be the person who can help
one of those organizations finally make

32
00:01:56.183 --> 00:01:59.757
that leap because they have
a professional on their team.

33
00:01:59.757 --> 00:02:02.522
All right, so
you've gotten the certification,

34
00:02:02.522 --> 00:02:04.942
you've gotten the fundamental skills,

35
00:02:04.942 --> 00:02:08.623
how do you make sure that you can
actually use them in the Cloud?

36
00:02:08.623 --> 00:02:09.995
I'm going to let you in a little secret.

37
00:02:09.995 --> 00:02:12.227
Go use the Cloud.

38
00:02:12.227 --> 00:02:16.323
Go take existing software,
throw it in the Cloud, and

39
00:02:16.323 --> 00:02:21.663
find all the tools that poke and
prod at the thing you just got running and

40
00:02:21.663 --> 00:02:24.973
it's going to tell you where you're weak.

41
00:02:24.973 --> 00:02:30.308
Learn those tools, because those
are the tools that the professionals use.

42
00:02:30.308 --> 00:02:33.276
Learning is a superpower.

43
00:02:33.276 --> 00:02:38.052
It gives you the ability to not only get
that job that you've been looking at,

44
00:02:38.052 --> 00:02:41.516
but it also gives you the ability
to define the next one.

45
00:02:41.516 --> 00:02:42.016
