00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.525
Hi there. In this video,

2
00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:05.865
we'll discuss
operating system, or

3
00:00:05.865 --> 00:00:07.740
OS, hardening and why it's

4
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.080
essential to keep the
entire network secure.

5
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:11.310
The operating system is

6
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:14.475
the interface between computer
hardware and the user.

7
00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:16.200
The OS is the first program

8
00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.850
loaded when a computer turns on.

9
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:20.220
The OS acts as an intermediary

10
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.385
between software applications
and the computer hardware.

11
00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:27.170
It's important to secure
the OS in each system

12
00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.000
because one insecure OS can

13
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.340
lead to a whole network
being compromised.

14
00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.070
There are many types of
operating systems, and they

15
00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.024
all share similar security
hardening practices.

16
00:00:37.024 --> 00:00:38.540
Let's talk about some of

17
00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:40.250
those security hardening
practices that

18
00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.110
are recommended to secure an OS.

19
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:43.760
Some OS hardening tasks

20
00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:45.470
are performed at
regular intervals,

21
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.320
like updates,
backups, and keeping

22
00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.500
an up-to-date list of devices
and authorized users.

23
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.630
Other tasks are performed only

24
00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.825
once as part of preliminary
safety measures.

25
00:00:56.825 --> 00:00:58.730
One example would be configuring

26
00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.315
a device setting to fit a
secure encryption standard.

27
00:01:01.315 --> 00:01:03.860
Let's begin with
OS hardening tasks

28
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.735
that are performed at
a regular interval,

29
00:01:05.735 --> 00:01:07.685
such as patch installation,

30
00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:09.940
also known as patch updates.

31
00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:13.640
A patch update is a software
and operating system, or

32
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.530
OS, update that addresses

33
00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.010
security vulnerabilities
within a program or product.

34
00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:21.500
Now we'll discuss
patch updates provided

35
00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.280
to the company by the
OS software vendor.

36
00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.690
With patch updates,
the OS should

37
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:29.180
be upgraded to its
latest software version.

38
00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.550
Sometimes patches are released

39
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:34.220
to fix a security
vulnerability in the software.

40
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.470
As soon as OS vendors publish

41
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:38.510
a patch and the
vulnerability fix,

42
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.730
malicious actors
know exactly where

43
00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:42.425
the vulnerability
is in systems

44
00:01:42.425 --> 00:01:44.410
running the out-of-date OS.

45
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:47.150
This is why it's important
for organizations to run

46
00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.080
patch updates as soon
as they are released.

47
00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.010
For example, my team

48
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:53.780
had to perform an
emergency patch to

49
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.325
address a recent vulnerability

50
00:01:55.325 --> 00:01:57.980
found in a commonly used
programming library.

51
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.710
The library is used
almost everywhere,

52
00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.140
so we had to quickly patch
most of our servers and

53
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.955
applications to fix
the vulnerability.

54
00:02:05.955 --> 00:02:08.675
The newly updated OS should be

55
00:02:08.675 --> 00:02:11.420
added to the baseline
configuration,

56
00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:13.710
also called the baseline image.

57
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.240
A baseline configuration
is a documented set of

58
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.625
specifications within a system

59
00:02:19.625 --> 00:02:22.385
that is used as a basis
for future builds,

60
00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:24.775
releases, and updates.

61
00:02:24.775 --> 00:02:27.320
For example, a
baseline may contain

62
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.760
a firewall rule with a list of

63
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:30.860
allowed and disallowed
network ports.

64
00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.735
If a security team suspects

65
00:02:32.735 --> 00:02:35.030
unusual activity
affecting the OS,

66
00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.700
they can compare the
current configuration to

67
00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.420
the baseline and make sure
that nothing has been changed.

68
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:43.940
Another hardening task
performed regularly is

69
00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:46.490
hardware and software disposal.

70
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.040
This ensures that
all old hardware

71
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.455
is properly wiped
and disposed of.

72
00:02:51.455 --> 00:02:53.330
It's also a good idea to delete

73
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:55.790
any unused software
applications since

74
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:57.470
some popular
programming languages

75
00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.380
have known vulnerabilities.

76
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.420
Removing unused software
makes sure that there aren't

77
00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.060
any unnecessary
vulnerabilities connected

78
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.430
with the programs that
the software uses.

79
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:09.770
The final OS hardening
technique that we'll

80
00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.680
discuss is implementing a
strong password policy.

81
00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.750
Strong password policies require

82
00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.900
that passwords follow
specific rules.

83
00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.100
For example, an
organization may set

84
00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.510
a password policy that requires

85
00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:22.354
a minimum of eight characters,

86
00:03:22.354 --> 00:03:25.030
a capital letter, a
number, and a symbol.

87
00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:27.375
To discourage malicious actors,

88
00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:28.970
a password policy usually

89
00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.800
states that a user
will lose access to

90
00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.360
the network after entering

91
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.120
the wrong password a certain
number of times in a row.

92
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.415
Some systems also require

93
00:03:37.415 --> 00:03:40.905
multi-factor
authentication, or MFA.

94
00:03:40.905 --> 00:03:42.755
MFA is a security measure

95
00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:45.530
which requires a user to
verify their identity in

96
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:49.025
two or more ways to access
a system or network.

97
00:03:49.025 --> 00:03:51.110
Ways of identifying
yourself include

98
00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:53.360
something you know,
like a password,

99
00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:56.285
something you have
like an ID card,

100
00:03:56.285 --> 00:03:59.825
or something unique about
you, like your fingerprint.

101
00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:03.290
To review, OS hardening is
a set of procedures that

102
00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:06.380
maintains OS security
and improves it.

103
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:07.565
Security measures like

104
00:04:07.565 --> 00:04:09.710
access privileges and
password policies

105
00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:12.050
frequently undergo
regular security checks

106
00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.685
as part of OS hardening.

107
00:04:13.685 --> 00:04:18.240
Coming up, we'll discuss
network hardening practices.
