00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.000
In this video, we'll discuss

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.610
packet sniffing,
with a focus on how

3
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.830
threat actors may use
this technique to

4
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:10.200
gain unauthorized
access to information.

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.180
Previously, you learned about

6
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.590
the information and data packets

7
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.345
that travel across the network.

8
00:00:15.345 --> 00:00:17.640
Packets include a
header which contains

9
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.085
the sender's and
receiver's IP addresses.

10
00:00:20.085 --> 00:00:22.530
Packets also contain
a body, which

11
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:24.900
may contain valuable
information like names,

12
00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.775
date of birth,
personal messages,

13
00:00:26.775 --> 00:00:29.710
financial information, and
credit card numbers.

14
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.810
Packet sniffing is
the practice of using

15
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.700
software tools to observe

16
00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.250
data as it moves
across a network.

17
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:38.975
As a security analyst,

18
00:00:38.975 --> 00:00:42.410
you may use packet sniffing
to analyze and capture

19
00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.230
packets when investigating
ongoing incidents

20
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.395
or debugging network issues.

21
00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:49.580
Later in this
certificate program,

22
00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:51.200
you'll gain hands-on practice

23
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.135
with some packet
sniffing software.

24
00:00:53.135 --> 00:00:56.570
However, malicious
actors may also use

25
00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.800
packet sniffing to look at

26
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:59.905
data that has not
been sent to them.

27
00:00:59.905 --> 00:01:02.900
This is a little bit like
opening somebody else's mail.

28
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.150
It's important for you
to learn about how

29
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.205
threat actors use
packet sniffing

30
00:01:07.205 --> 00:01:09.380
with harmful intent
so you can be

31
00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.875
prepared to protect against
these malicious acts.

32
00:01:11.875 --> 00:01:14.510
Malicious actors may insert
themselves in the middle of

33
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.940
an authorized connection
between two devices.

34
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.310
Then they can use packet
sniffing to spy on

35
00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.965
every data packet as it
comes across their device.

36
00:01:21.965 --> 00:01:24.530
The goal is to find
valuable information in

37
00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.000
the data packets that they can

38
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.895
then use to their advantage.

39
00:01:27.895 --> 00:01:30.649
Attackers can use
software applications

40
00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:34.010
or a hardware device to
look into data packets.

41
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:36.560
Malicious actors can access
a network packet with

42
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.325
a packet sniffer and make
changes to the data.

43
00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:40.710
They may change the information

44
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.705
in the body of the packet,

45
00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:44.075
like altering a recipient's
bank account number.

46
00:01:45.075 --> 00:01:47.405
Packet sniffing can
be passive or active.

47
00:01:47.405 --> 00:01:50.000
Passive packet
sniffing is a type of

48
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.155
attack where data packets
are read in transit.

49
00:01:53.155 --> 00:01:55.520
Since all the
traffic on a network

50
00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.470
is visible to any
host on the hub,

51
00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:58.850
malicious actors can view

52
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.200
all the information going

53
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.260
in and out of the device
they are targeting.

54
00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.690
Thinking back to the example
of a letter being delivered,

55
00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.850
we can compare a
passive packet sniffing

56
00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.175
attack to a postal
delivery person

57
00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:12.235
maliciously reading
somebody's mail.

58
00:02:12.235 --> 00:02:14.630
The postal worker, or packet

59
00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.270
sniffer, has the right
to deliver the mail,

60
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.410
but not the right to read
the information inside.

61
00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:23.120
Active packet
sniffing is a type of

62
00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.480
attack where data packets
are manipulated in transit.

63
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.100
This may include injecting

64
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.260
internet protocols to
redirect the packets to

65
00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:31.970
an unintended port or

66
00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.735
changing the information
the packet contains.

67
00:02:34.735 --> 00:02:37.220
Active packet
sniffing attack would

68
00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.605
be like a neighbor telling
the delivery person

69
00:02:39.605 --> 00:02:42.695
"I'll deliver that mail for
you," and then reading the mail

70
00:02:42.695 --> 00:02:46.205
or changing the letter before
putting it in your mailbox.

71
00:02:46.205 --> 00:02:48.200
Even though your
neighbor knows you

72
00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.615
and even if they deliver
it to the correct house,

73
00:02:50.615 --> 00:02:52.250
they are actively going out of

74
00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:54.875
their way to engage in
malicious behavior.

75
00:02:55.875 --> 00:02:56.780
The good news is that

76
00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.320
malicious packet sniffing
can be prevented.

77
00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.235
Let's look at a few ways

78
00:03:01.235 --> 00:03:02.630
the network security
professional

79
00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.330
can prevent these attacks.

80
00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.990
One way to protect against

81
00:03:05.990 --> 00:03:07.580
malicious packet
sniffing is to use

82
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.290
a VPN to encrypt and protect

83
00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:11.660
data as it travels
across the network.

84
00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.730
If you don't remember
how VPNs work,

85
00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:14.990
you can revisit the video about

86
00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:17.815
this topic in the previous
section of the program.

87
00:03:17.815 --> 00:03:19.990
When you use a VPN,

88
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:22.240
hackers might interfere
with your traffic,

89
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:23.845
but they won't be
able to decode it

90
00:03:23.845 --> 00:03:26.375
to read it and read your
private information.

91
00:03:26.375 --> 00:03:27.940
Another way to add a layer of

92
00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.800
protection against packet
sniffing is to make sure

93
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.660
that websites you have use

94
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.735
HTTPS at the beginning
of the domain address.

95
00:03:34.735 --> 00:03:39.460
Previously, we discussed
how HTTPS uses SSL/TLS to

96
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:41.740
encrypt data and
prevent eavesdropping

97
00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.455
when malicious actors spy on
network transmissions.

98
00:03:44.455 --> 00:03:47.080
One final way to help
protect yourself against

99
00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.670
malicious packet sniffing is to

100
00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:51.080
avoid using unprotected WiFi.

101
00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.320
You usually find
unprotected WiFi in

102
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.360
public places like coffee shops,

103
00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.249
restaurants, or airports.

104
00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:59.535
These networks don't
use encryption.

105
00:03:59.535 --> 00:04:02.375
This means that anyone on
the network can access

106
00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:05.555
all of the data traveling
to and from your device.

107
00:04:05.555 --> 00:04:07.940
One precaution you
can take is avoiding

108
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.650
free public WiFi
unless you have

109
00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:13.165
a VPN service already
installed on your device.

110
00:04:14.165 --> 00:04:16.190
Now you know how
threat actors may use

111
00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:17.510
packet sniffing and how to

112
00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.505
protect a network
from these attacks.

113
00:04:19.505 --> 00:04:23.190
Let's move on to discuss
other network intrusions.
