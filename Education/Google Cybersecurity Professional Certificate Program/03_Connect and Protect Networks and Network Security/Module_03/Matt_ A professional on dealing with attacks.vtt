00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.604
My name's Matt,
I'm a chaos specialist at Google.

2
00:00:07.604 --> 00:00:11.348
They let us choose our own job titles
to best describe what it is we do.

3
00:00:11.348 --> 00:00:13.426
I spend a lot of my time planning for

4
00:00:13.426 --> 00:00:17.514
how to take care of anything that
might possibly be going wrong, and

5
00:00:17.514 --> 00:00:22.340
when it does happen, putting a team in
place to fix it as quickly as possible.

6
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.380
I had no intention of being
in technology at all.

7
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.778
In high school, I was a lifeguard, first
at public pools and then at a state beach.

8
00:00:29.778 --> 00:00:32.626
Lifeguarding got me into
really enjoying rescue.

9
00:00:32.626 --> 00:00:37.397
So I got an EMT license, went through
firefighter school. About halfway through

10
00:00:37.397 --> 00:00:42.438
my college process, and well into when I
was being a firefighter on a daily basis.

11
00:00:42.438 --> 00:00:45.030
I was dealing with some burnout,
some stress.

12
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.688
I needed a change in my life.

13
00:00:46.688 --> 00:00:50.563
And a friend of mine who I'd been
online gaming with since the early days

14
00:00:50.563 --> 00:00:53.082
of online gaming,
when it was all text based,

15
00:00:53.082 --> 00:00:56.804
he said, I can tell you're burning
out hard and you need a change.

16
00:00:56.804 --> 00:00:59.946
My friends and I are going to
San Francisco to start a startup.

17
00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:01.092
Will you come with us?

18
00:01:01.092 --> 00:01:04.772
And I said, you realize I am
not a computer guy, right?

19
00:01:04.772 --> 00:01:07.688
And he said, no, you're a computer guy,
you just won't admit it.

20
00:01:07.688 --> 00:01:11.458
The same thing that has drawn me into
incident response in tech is what

21
00:01:11.458 --> 00:01:13.806
originally drew me to medical response.

22
00:01:13.806 --> 00:01:17.272
I really love being there for
people on their worst day.

23
00:01:17.272 --> 00:01:20.044
Being there when people
really need you and

24
00:01:20.044 --> 00:01:24.972
they don't know where else to turn to
has always just fed this part of me, and

25
00:01:24.972 --> 00:01:30.610
I'm lucky to find that same joy in DFIR,
Digital Forensics and Incident Response.

26
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.976
What type of attacks
have we faced at Google?

27
00:01:32.976 --> 00:01:34.656
That's a hard question to answer,

28
00:01:34.656 --> 00:01:38.368
because we face all of the kinds of
attacks that most other companies face.

29
00:01:38.368 --> 00:01:41.871
People after ransomware,
people after industrial secrets,

30
00:01:41.871 --> 00:01:45.490
other countries looking for
intelligence information.

31
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.324
There was a really interesting attack
that occurred a little while ago.

32
00:01:48.324 --> 00:01:52.663
They were interested in getting a lot of
information from technical companies,

33
00:01:52.663 --> 00:01:55.598
specifically about
vulnerabilities in software.

34
00:01:55.598 --> 00:01:59.416
And they put in place a long running
campaign to build personalities on

35
00:01:59.416 --> 00:02:03.365
social media as though they were
legitimate security researchers, and

36
00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:06.602
then reach out to other security
researchers in our field,

37
00:02:06.602 --> 00:02:11.250
build relationships, and then just at
the right moment, sneak in some malware.

38
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.731
Being under attack by an adversary
who's made some progress is incredibly

39
00:02:14.731 --> 00:02:15.458
stressful.

40
00:02:15.458 --> 00:02:17.526
The first things you're thinking and

41
00:02:17.526 --> 00:02:20.278
feeling are a little bit
of a sense of panic.

42
00:02:20.278 --> 00:02:22.316
Oh no, this is going to be a bad day.

43
00:02:22.316 --> 00:02:24.336
How long am I going to be
awake working on this?

44
00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:25.136
What have they done?

45
00:02:25.136 --> 00:02:26.480
What am I going to do?

46
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:31.292
And for me, the mantra that I repeat
to myself is, as an incident responder,

47
00:02:31.292 --> 00:02:32.560
I am here to help.

48
00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.663
The things that are most
important to having a good outcome

49
00:02:35.663 --> 00:02:38.891
in an incident are what we call
the 3Cs: Command, Control and

50
00:02:38.891 --> 00:02:43.417
Communications. Meaning someone needs to
be in charge of it affirmatively leading.

51
00:02:43.417 --> 00:02:46.571
Someone needs to be exerting
control over everyone involved so

52
00:02:46.571 --> 00:02:50.201
that everyone's aligned, focused on
the mission, and the biggest and

53
00:02:50.201 --> 00:02:53.510
most important one of them
all: proper communications.

54
00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:56.719
If you have something to
offer to the incident,

55
00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:00.024
don't just go do it,
Communicate to someone.

56
00:03:00.024 --> 00:03:02.418
I think I could do this
to help us make progress.

57
00:03:02.418 --> 00:03:05.020
I think if we look over here,
we'll find more data.

58
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:08.766
The advice that I would give somebody who
wants to get into cybersecurity is if you

59
00:03:08.766 --> 00:03:10.588
want it, you probably belong here.

60
00:03:10.588 --> 00:03:15.191
The more people we have in here, who
are passionate, curious question askers,

61
00:03:15.191 --> 00:03:18.848
who want to know more, who want to
build better, and who care about

62
00:03:18.848 --> 00:03:23.046
making every thing more secure for
the people who have to use technology,

63
00:03:23.046 --> 00:03:26.800
those are people we want in
the industry and I would want you here.
