Nice job finishing this section!

2
00:00:03.015 --> 00:00:05.160
Let's review what
you've learned so far.

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.530
We discussed how to
secure networks.

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.870
We also learned about
network intrusion tactics

5
00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.495
like malicious packet
sniffing and IP spoofing.

6
00:00:12.495 --> 00:00:14.430
Finally, we discussed how

7
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.235
a security analyst can
protect against these attacks.

8
00:00:17.235 --> 00:00:19.320
You've learned
about DoS and DDoS

9
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.945
attacks like ICMP
flooding, SYN attacks,

10
00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:23.325
and the ping of death,

11
00:00:23.325 --> 00:00:25.170
which try to
overwhelming a network by

12
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:27.330
flooding it with
unwanted data packets.

13
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:29.130
Now, just think about everything you

14
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.080
know already about
network attacks.

15
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.060
What you've learned in
these videos will be

16
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:35.595
essential in your work
as a security analyst.

17
00:00:35.595 --> 00:00:37.260
Coming up, you'll learn

18
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:38.820
about how security
analysts can protect

19
00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.970
the network using various
security hardening techniques.
