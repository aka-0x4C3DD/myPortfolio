00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.480
Let's start by answering the question,
why do we need secure networks?

2
00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:11.198
As you've learned, networks are constantly
at risk of attack from malicious hackers.

3
00:00:11.198 --> 00:00:16.029
Attackers can infiltrate networks via
malware, spoofing, or packet sniffing.

4
00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:20.242
Network operations can also be disrupted
by attacks such as packet flooding.

5
00:00:20.242 --> 00:00:23.051
As we go along,
you're going to learn about these and

6
00:00:23.051 --> 00:00:26.202
other common network intrusion
attacks in more detail.

7
00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:29.730
Protecting a network from these
types of attacks is important.

8
00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.930
If even one of them happens, it could have
a catastrophic impact on an organization.

9
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.092
Attacks can harm an organization
by leaking valuable or

10
00:00:37.092 --> 00:00:38.790
confidential information.

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.896
They can also be damaging to
an organization's reputation and

12
00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:44.836
impact customer retention.

13
00:00:44.836 --> 00:00:49.310
Mitigating attacks may also cost
the organization money and time.

14
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:50.804
Over the last few years,

15
00:00:50.804 --> 00:00:55.380
there have been a number of examples
of damage that cyber attacks can cause.

16
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.326
One notorious example was an attack
against the American home-improvement

17
00:01:00.326 --> 00:01:02.615
chain, Home Depot, in 2014.

18
00:01:02.615 --> 00:01:06.761
A group of hackers compromised and
infected Home Depot servers with malware.

19
00:01:06.761 --> 00:01:11.277
By the time network administrators shut
down the attack, the hackers had already

20
00:01:11.277 --> 00:01:15.620
taken the credit and debit card
information for over 56 million customers.

21
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.600
Now, you know why it's so
important to secure a network.

22
00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.437
But to keep a network secure,

23
00:01:20.437 --> 00:01:23.971
you need to know what kinds of
attacks to protect it from.

24
00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:26.760
Coming up, you'll learn about
some common network attacks.
