Hey there! Welcome to this video
about securing networks from attacks.

2
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:07.959
You've come a long way already in
your understanding of networks and

3
00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:09.024
network security.

4
00:00:10.024 --> 00:00:10.955
Now you'll learn how to secure networks,

We're going to discuss how network
intrusion tactics can present a threat to

7
00:00:18.306 --> 00:00:21.953
networks and how a security analyst
can protect against network attacks.
