00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.270
Next, let's learn about

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.600
another kind of network attack
called IP spoofing.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:08.700
IP spoofing is a network attack

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.370
performed when an attacker
changes the source IP of

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.410
a data packet to impersonate

6
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:16.300
an authorized system and
gain access to a network.

7
00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.780
In this kind of attack,

8
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:19.520
the hacker is pretending
to be someone they are

9
00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.170
not so they can communicate over

10
00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.150
the network with the
target computer and get

11
00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.180
past firewall rules that may
prevent outside traffic.

12
00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.035
Some common IP spoofing
attacks are on-path attacks,

13
00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:32.790
replay attacks,
and smurf attacks.

14
00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:34.650
Let's discuss these
one at a time.

15
00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:36.800
An on-path attack is

16
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.320
an attack where the malicious
actor places themselves in

17
00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.480
the middle of an
authorized connection

18
00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.995
and intercepts or alters
the data in transit.

19
00:00:44.995 --> 00:00:47.300
On-path attackers gain access to

20
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.225
the network and put themselves
between two devices,

21
00:00:50.225 --> 00:00:52.495
like a web browser
and a web server.

22
00:00:52.495 --> 00:00:54.110
Then they sniff the packet

23
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:55.610
information to learn the IP and

24
00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.290
MAC addresses to devices

25
00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.045
that are communicating
with each other.

26
00:00:59.045 --> 00:01:01.040
After they have
this information,

27
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.165
they can pretend to be
either of these devices.

28
00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:06.930
Another type of attack
is a replay attack.

29
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.360
A replay attack is

30
00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.680
a network attack performed when

31
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.150
a malicious actor intercepts

32
00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:13.340
a data packet in
transit and delays

33
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.235
it or repeats it
at another time.

34
00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:18.200
A delayed packet can cause

35
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.660
connection issues between
target computers,

36
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.640
or a malicious actor may take

37
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.320
a network transmission
that was sent by

38
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:26.720
an authorized user
and repeat it at

39
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.945
a later time to impersonate
the authorized user.

40
00:01:30.945 --> 00:01:32.600
A smurf attack is
a combination of

41
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:35.950
a DDoS attack and an
IP spoofing attack.

42
00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:38.900
The attacker sniffs an
authorized user's IP address

43
00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.955
and floods it with packets.

44
00:01:40.955 --> 00:01:43.220
This overwhelms the target computer and can

45
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:45.835
bring down a server or
the entire network.

46
00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:47.180
Now that you've learned about

47
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.010
different kinds of IP spoofing,

48
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.900
let's talk about
how you can protect

49
00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:53.015
the network from this kind of attack.

50
00:01:53.015 --> 00:01:54.935
As you previously learned,

51
00:01:54.935 --> 00:01:58.280
encryption should always be
implemented so that the data

52
00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.810
in your network transfers can't

53
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:01.640
be read by malicious actors.

54
00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.410
Firewalls can be configured

55
00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:05.440
to protect against IP spoofing.

56
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:07.880
IP spoofing makes it seem like

57
00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:10.175
the malicious actor
is an authorized user

58
00:02:10.175 --> 00:02:12.050
by changing the
sender's address of

59
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:15.320
the data packet to match the
target network's address.

60
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.620
So if a firewall receives a data
packet from the internet

61
00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.435
where the sender's IP address

62
00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:22.520
is the same as the
private network,

63
00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.664
then the firewall will
deny the transmission

64
00:02:24.664 --> 00:02:26.870
since all the devices
with that IP address

65
00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.245
should already be on
the local network.

66
00:02:29.245 --> 00:02:31.250
You can make sure
that your firewalls

67
00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.560
configure correctly
by creating a rule to

68
00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.840
reject all incoming
traffic that has

69
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.855
the same IP address
as the local network.

70
00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:40.825
That's it for IP spoofing.

71
00:02:40.825 --> 00:02:42.800
You've learned how IP
spoofing is used in

72
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:45.050
some common attacks
like on-path attacks,

73
00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:48.450
replay attacks,
and smurf attacks.
