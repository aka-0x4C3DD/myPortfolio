00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.375
Welcome back. In this video,

2
00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:06.330
we're going to discuss
denial of service attacks.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.640
A denial of service attack is

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.890
an attack that targets
a network or server

5
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.050
and floods it with
network traffic.

6
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.465
The objective of a
denial of service attack,

7
00:00:15.465 --> 00:00:17.880
or a DoS attack, is to disrupt

8
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.515
normal business
operations by

9
00:00:19.515 --> 00:00:22.065
overloading an
organization's network.

10
00:00:22.065 --> 00:00:24.390
The goal of the
attack is to send

11
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.865
so much information
to a network device

12
00:00:26.865 --> 00:00:28.635
that it crashes or is

13
00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:31.120
unable to respond to
legitimate users.

14
00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.620
This means that the
organization won't

15
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.020
be able to conduct their
normal business operations,

16
00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.450
which can cost them
money and time.

17
00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.460
A network crash can
also leave them

18
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:43.340
vulnerable to other security
threats and attacks.

19
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.310
A distributed denial of service
attack, or DDoS,

20
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.400
is a kind of DoS
attack that uses

21
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.350
multiple devices or servers in

22
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.450
different locations to flood

23
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.015
the target network
with unwanted traffic.

24
00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:58.880
Use of numerous devices
makes it more likely that

25
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.080
the total amount of traffic

26
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.575
sent will overwhelm
the target server.

27
00:01:02.575 --> 00:01:07.095
Remember, DoS stands
for denial of service.

28
00:01:07.095 --> 00:01:09.050
So it doesn't matter what part

29
00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:11.060
of the network the
attacker overloads;

30
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.990
if they overload
anything, they win.

31
00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.820
An unfortunate example I've

32
00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.605
seen is an attacker who crafted

33
00:01:17.605 --> 00:01:19.990
a very careful
packet that caused

34
00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.200
a router to spend extra time
processing the request.

35
00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.035
The overall traffic volume
didn't overload the router;

36
00:01:26.035 --> 00:01:28.435
the specifics within
the packet did.

37
00:01:29.435 --> 00:01:31.480
Now we'll discuss network
level DoS attacks

38
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.105
that target network
bandwidth to slow traffic.

39
00:01:34.105 --> 00:01:37.640
Let's learn about three common
network level DoS attacks.

40
00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:40.455
The first is called
a SYN flood attack.

41
00:01:40.455 --> 00:01:42.580
A SYN flood attack is a type of

42
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.310
DoS attack that simulates
the TCP connection

43
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:48.485
and floods the server
with SYN packets.

44
00:01:48.485 --> 00:01:50.890
Let's break this
definition down a bit

45
00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.810
more by taking a closer look at

46
00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:55.180
the handshake process
that is used to establish

47
00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.025
a TCP connection between
a device and a server.

48
00:01:59.025 --> 00:02:02.270
The first step in the handshake
is for the device to send

49
00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.935
a SYN, or synchronize,
request to the server.

50
00:02:05.935 --> 00:02:07.580
Then, the server responds with

51
00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:09.470
a SYN/ACK packet to

52
00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.765
acknowledge the receipt
of the device's request

53
00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:13.130
and leaves a port open for

54
00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.830
the final step of the handshake.

55
00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:16.220
Once the server receives

56
00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:18.515
the final ACK packet
from the device,

57
00:02:18.515 --> 00:02:21.010
a TCP connection is established.

58
00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.440
Malicious actors can take
advantage of the protocol by

59
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:25.730
flooding a server with

60
00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:28.310
SYN packet requests for the
first part of the handshake.

61
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:30.380
But if the number
of SYN requests is

62
00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.290
larger than the number of
available ports on the server,

63
00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.160
then the server
will be overwhelmed

64
00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:37.155
and become unable to function.

65
00:02:38.155 --> 00:02:40.475
Let's discuss two other
common DoS attacks

66
00:02:40.475 --> 00:02:43.795
that use another
protocol called ICMP.

67
00:02:43.795 --> 00:02:48.724
ICMP stands for Internet
Control Message Protocol.

68
00:02:48.724 --> 00:02:52.910
ICMP is an internet
protocol used by devices

69
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.200
to tell each other about

70
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.365
data transmission errors
across the network.

71
00:02:57.365 --> 00:02:59.720
Think of ICMP like a request

72
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:01.990
for a status update
from a device.

73
00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:03.380
The device will return

74
00:03:03.380 --> 00:03:06.455
error messages if there
is a network concern.

75
00:03:06.455 --> 00:03:08.540
You can think of this like

76
00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:10.460
the ICMP request
checking in with

77
00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.895
the device to make
sure that all is well.

78
00:03:12.895 --> 00:03:15.360
An ICMP flood attack

79
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:18.290
is a type of DoS attack
performed by an attacker

80
00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.580
repeatedly sending ICMP
packets to a network server.

81
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.275
This forces the server
to send an ICMP packet.

82
00:03:26.275 --> 00:03:29.600
This eventually uses up all
the bandwidth for incoming

83
00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:32.945
and outgoing traffic and
causes the server to crash.

84
00:03:32.945 --> 00:03:35.255
Both of the attacks
we've discussed so far,

85
00:03:35.255 --> 00:03:38.060
SYN flood and ICMP flood,

86
00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:40.460
take advantage of
communication protocols

87
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.380
by sending an overwhelming
number of requests.

88
00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.010
There are also attacks
that can overwhelm

89
00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:48.620
the server with one big request.

90
00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:50.300
One example that we'll discuss

91
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:51.995
is called the ping of death.

92
00:03:52.995 --> 00:03:53.990
A ping of death attack is

93
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.210
a type of DoS attack that
is caused when a hacker

94
00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:58.040
pings a system by sending it

95
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.185
an oversized ICMP packet

96
00:04:00.185 --> 00:04:02.450
that is bigger
than 64 kilobytes,

97
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.675
the maximum size for a
correctly formed ICMP packet.

98
00:04:05.675 --> 00:04:07.820
Pinging a vulnerable
network server with

99
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.890
an oversized ICMP packet

100
00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.930
will overload the system
and cause it to crash.

101
00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:16.630
Think of this like dropping
a rock on a small anthill.

102
00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:19.280
Each individual ant can
carry a certain amount of

103
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.160
weight while transporting
food to and from the anthill.

104
00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:24.695
But if a large rock is
dropped on the anthill,

105
00:04:24.695 --> 00:04:27.470
then many ants will be crushed,
and the colony is unable to

106
00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:30.215
function until it rebuilds
its operations elsewhere.

107
00:04:31.215 --> 00:04:32.310
Now that's it for DoS
and DDoS attacks.

108
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:33.350
Coming up, we'll continue to

109
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:36.540
discuss common network attacks.
