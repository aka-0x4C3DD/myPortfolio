00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.845
Congratulations on the
progress you've made so far!

2
00:00:03.845 --> 00:00:06.030
In this section,
you'll learn about how

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:08.940
networks operate using
tools and protocols.

4
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.370
These are the concepts
that you'll use every

5
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:13.500
day in your work as
a security analyst.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.990
The tools and protocols you'll
learn in this section of

7
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:17.640
the program will
help you protect

8
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.025
your organization's
network from attacks.

9
00:00:20.025 --> 00:00:23.190
Did you know that malicious
actors can take advantage of

10
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:26.175
data moving from one device
to another on a network?

11
00:00:26.175 --> 00:00:27.660
Thankfully, there are tools and

12
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.980
protocols to ensure the network

13
00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.965
stays protected against
this type of threat.

14
00:00:32.965 --> 00:00:35.130
As an example, I once
identified an attack

15
00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.630
based solely on
the fact they were

16
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.445
using the wrong protocol.

17
00:00:38.445 --> 00:00:40.415
The network traffic
volumes were right, and it

18
00:00:40.415 --> 00:00:42.205
was coming from a trusted IP,

19
00:00:42.205 --> 00:00:43.940
but it was on the wrong protocol,

20
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.770
which tipped us off
enough to shut down

21
00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.100
the attack before they
caused real damage.

22
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.380
First, we'll discuss some
common network protocols.

23
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.950
Then we'll discuss virtual
private networks, or VPNs.

24
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:56.660
And finally, we'll learn about

25
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:59.875
firewall security zones
and proxy servers.

26
00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:01.610
Now that you have an
idea of where we're

27
00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:04.140
headed, let's get started.
