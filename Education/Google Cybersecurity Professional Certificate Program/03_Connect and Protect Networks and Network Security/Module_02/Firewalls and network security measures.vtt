00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.640
In this video, you'll

2
00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.649
learn about different
types of firewalls.

3
00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:06.224
These include hardware,

4
00:00:06.224 --> 00:00:09.120
software, and
cloud-based firewalls.

5
00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.860
You'll also learn the
difference between

6
00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.680
a stateless and
stateful firewall and

7
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.330
cover some of the
basic operations

8
00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:16.950
that a firewall performs.

9
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.780
Finally, you will explore how

10
00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.430
proxy servers are used to

11
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.545
add a layer of security
to the network.

12
00:00:23.545 --> 00:00:24.990
A firewall is a network
security device that

13
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.450
monitors traffic to
and from your network.

14
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:30.000
It either allows
traffic or it blocks

15
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.535
it based on a defined
set of security rules.

16
00:00:32.535 --> 00:00:34.755
A firewall can use
port filtering,

17
00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:36.000
which blocks or allows

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.805
certain port numbers to limit
unwanted communication.

19
00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:40.880
For example, it could have a rule

20
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:42.680
that only allows
communications on port

21
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:45.390
443 for HTTPS or port

22
00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.500
25 for email and blocks
everything else.

23
00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:50.630
These firewall settings
will be determined by

24
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:52.925
the organization's
security policy.

25
00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:56.120
Let's talk about a few
different kinds of firewalls.

26
00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.190
A hardware firewall is
considered the most

27
00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:00.620
basic way to defend against
threats to a network.

28
00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.765
A hardware firewall inspects

29
00:01:02.765 --> 00:01:04.070
each data packet before it's

30
00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:05.795
allowed to enter the network.

31
00:01:05.795 --> 00:01:07.670
A software firewall performs

32
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.875
the same functions as
a hardware firewall,

33
00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:11.884
but it's not a physical device.

34
00:01:11.884 --> 00:01:13.820
Instead, it's a software program

35
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.340
installed on a computer
or on a server.

36
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.980
If the software firewall is
installed on a computer,

37
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:20.660
it will analyze all the traffic

38
00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:22.450
received by that computer.

39
00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.280
If the software firewall
is installed on a server,

40
00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:28.840
it will protect all the devices
connected to the server.

41
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:31.490
A software firewall
typically costs

42
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.025
less than purchasing a
separate physical device,

43
00:01:34.025 --> 00:01:36.455
and it doesn't take
up any extra space.

44
00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:38.690
But because it is a
software program,

45
00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:40.400
it will add some
processing burden

46
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.070
to the individual devices.

47
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.620
Organizations may choose to
use a cloud-based firewall.

48
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:48.170
Cloud service providers
offer firewalls as

49
00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:51.830
a service, or FaaS,
for organizations.

50
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:54.680
Cloud-based firewalls
are software firewalls

51
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:56.755
hosted by a cloud
service provider.

52
00:01:56.755 --> 00:01:59.390
Organizations can configure
the firewall rules

53
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.400
on the cloud service
provider's interface,

54
00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.700
and the firewall will perform
security operations on

55
00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.890
all incoming traffic before

56
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:09.290
it reaches the organizationâ€™s onsite network.

57
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.110
Cloud-based firewalls also
protect any assets or

58
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:13.880
processes that an organization

59
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.830
might be using in the cloud.

60
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:18.020
All the firewalls we
have discussed can be

61
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.180
either stateful or stateless.

62
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.190
The terms "stateful" and "stateless"

63
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.325
refer to how the
firewall operates.

64
00:02:24.325 --> 00:02:26.450
Stateful refers to a class

65
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:27.680
of firewall that keeps track of

66
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.195
information passing through it

67
00:02:29.195 --> 00:02:31.565
and proactively
filters out threats.

68
00:02:31.565 --> 00:02:33.470
A stateful firewall analyzes

69
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.090
network traffic for
characteristics and

70
00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:37.280
behavior that appear suspicious

71
00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.365
and stops them from
entering the network.

72
00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:41.630
Stateless refers to a class

73
00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.040
of firewall that
operates based on

74
00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.870
predefined rules and does not

75
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.075
keep track of information
from data packets.

76
00:02:47.075 --> 00:02:49.940
A stateless firewall
only acts according to

77
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.910
preconfigured rules set by
the firewall administrator.

78
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:55.700
The rules programmed by the
firewall administrator tell

79
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.535
the device what to accept
and what to reject.

80
00:02:58.535 --> 00:03:01.775
A stateless firewall doesn't
store analyzed information.

81
00:03:01.775 --> 00:03:03.230
It also doesn't discover

82
00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:05.915
suspicious trends like a
stateful firewall does.

83
00:03:05.915 --> 00:03:08.510
For this reason, stateless
firewalls are considered

84
00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:11.060
less secure than
stateful firewalls.

85
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:13.745
A next generation
firewall, or NGFW,

86
00:03:13.745 --> 00:03:16.820
provides even more security
than a stateful firewall.

87
00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:18.410
Not only does an NGFW provide

88
00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:21.260
stateful inspection of
incoming and outgoing traffic,

89
00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:22.640
but it also performs more

90
00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:24.080
in-depth security functions like

91
00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:26.975
deep packet inspection
and intrusion protection.

92
00:03:26.975 --> 00:03:28.910
Some NGFWs connect to

93
00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:30.770
cloud-based threat
intelligence services

94
00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:32.360
so they can quickly update to

95
00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.960
protect against
emerging cyber threats.

96
00:03:35.960 --> 00:03:37.220
Now you have a
basic understanding

97
00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.290
of firewalls and how they work.

98
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:42.635
We learned that firewalls
can be hardware or software.

99
00:03:42.635 --> 00:03:44.630
We also discussed the
difference between

100
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.940
a stateless and
stateful firewall

101
00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.700
and the security benefits
of a stateful firewall.

102
00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:52.970
Finally, we discussed
next generation firewalls

103
00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:55.355
and the security
benefits they provide.

104
00:03:55.355 --> 00:03:59.550
Coming up, we'll learn more
about virtual networks.
