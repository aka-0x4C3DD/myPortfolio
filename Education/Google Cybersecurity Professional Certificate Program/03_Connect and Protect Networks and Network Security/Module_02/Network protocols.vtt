1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.375
Networks benefit
from having rules.

2
00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.310
Rules ensure that data sent over

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.380
the network gets to
the right place.

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.920
These rules are known
as network protocols.

5
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:12.870
Network protocols are a set of

6
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.670
rules used by two
or more devices on

7
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:16.770
a network to describe
the order of

8
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:19.515
delivery and the
structure of the data.

9
00:00:20.515 --> 00:00:21.900
Let's use a scenario
to demonstrate

10
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.210
a few different types
of network protocols

11
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.475
and how they work
together on a network.

12
00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.325
Say you want to access your
favorite recipe website.

13
00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:31.020
You go to the address
bar at the top of

14
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.305
your browser and type in
the website's address.

15
00:00:33.305 --> 00:00:38.105
For example:
www.yummyrecipesforme.org.

16
00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:40.475
Before you gain access
to the website,

17
00:00:40.475 --> 00:00:41.570
your device will establish

18
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:43.635
communications
with a web server.

19
00:00:43.635 --> 00:00:46.010
That communication
uses a protocol called

20
00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.175
the Transmission Control
Protocol, or TCP.

21
00:00:49.175 --> 00:00:52.340
TCP is an internet communications
protocol that allows

22
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.885
two devices to form a
connection and stream data.

23
00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:58.580
TCP also verifies both devices

24
00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:01.955
before allowing any further
communications to take place.

25
00:01:01.955 --> 00:01:05.200
This is often referred
to as a handshake.

26
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.035
Once communication is established
using a TCP handshake,

27
00:01:09.035 --> 00:01:11.105
a request is made
to the network.

28
00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:13.265
Using our example,
we have requested

29
00:01:13.265 --> 00:01:16.205
data from the Yummy
Recipes For Me server.

30
00:01:16.205 --> 00:01:18.950
Their servers will respond
to that request and send

31
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.090
data packets back to

32
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:22.490
your device so that you
can view the web page.

33
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:25.025
As data packets move
across the network,

34
00:01:25.025 --> 00:01:28.265
they move between network
devices such as routers.

35
00:01:28.265 --> 00:01:31.820
The Address Resolution
Protocol, or ARP, is used to

36
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:33.260
determine the MAC address of

37
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.465
the next router or
device on the path.

38
00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:38.570
This ensures that the data
gets to the right place.

39
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.100
Now the communication has been

40
00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.755
established and the
destination device is known,

41
00:01:42.755 --> 00:01:45.895
it's time to access the
Yummy Recipes For Me website.

42
00:01:46.895 --> 00:01:50.870
The Hypertext Transfer
Protocol Secure, or HTTPS, is

43
00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:53.210
a network protocol that
provides a secure method of

44
00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.275
communication between
client and website servers.

45
00:01:56.275 --> 00:01:59.150
It allows your web browser
to securely send a request

46
00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.195
for a webpage to the Yummy
Recipes For Me server

47
00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:04.820
and receive a webpage
as a response.

48
00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.190
Next comes a protocol called the

49
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:09.634
Domain Name System, or DNS,

50
00:02:09.634 --> 00:02:11.720
which is a network
protocol that translate

51
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.840
internet domain names
into IP addresses.

52
00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.580
The DNS protocol sends

53
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:18.440
the domain name and
the web address to

54
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.300
a DNS server that retrieves

55
00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.035
the IP address of the website
you were trying to access,

56
00:02:23.035 --> 00:02:25.940
in this case, Yummy
Recipes For Me.

57
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.450
The IP address is included
as a destination address for

58
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.130
the data packets traveling to

59
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.230
the Yummy Recipes
For Me web server.

60
00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:35.480
So just by visiting one website,

61
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:36.650
the device on your networks are

62
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:38.299
using four different protocols:

63
00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:42.380
TCP, ARP, HTTPS, and DNS.

64
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:44.240
These are just some
of the protocols

65
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.740
used in network communications.

66
00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.020
To help you learn more about
the different protocols,

67
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:49.355
we'll discuss them further

68
00:02:49.355 --> 00:02:50.945
in an upcoming course material.

69
00:02:51.945 --> 00:02:53.575
But how do these protocols
relate to security?

70
00:02:53.575 --> 00:02:56.120
Well, on the Yummy Recipes
For Me website example,

71
00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:58.430
we used HTTPS, which is

72
00:02:58.430 --> 00:02:59.510
a secure protocol that

73
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.660
requests a webpage
from a web server.

74
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.670
HTTPS encrypts data using

75
00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.925
the Secure Sockets Layer and
Transport Layer Security,

76
00:03:07.925 --> 00:03:10.825
otherwise known as SSL/TLS.

77
00:03:10.825 --> 00:03:13.130
This helps keep the
information secure from

78
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.905
malicious actors who want to
steal valuable information.

79
00:03:16.905 --> 00:03:17.390
That's a lot of information and

80
00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:19.010
a lot of protocols to remember.

81
00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:21.110
Throughout your career
as a security analyst,

82
00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:22.220
you'll become more familiar with

83
00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.130
network protocols and use them
in your daily activities.
