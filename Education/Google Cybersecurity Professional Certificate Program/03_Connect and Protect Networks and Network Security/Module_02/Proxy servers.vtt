00:00:01.035 --> 00:00:04.839
Previously, we discussed how firewalls,
VPNs, and

2
00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.871
security zones help to secure networks.

3
00:00:07.871 --> 00:00:12.572
Next, we'll cover how to secure
internal networks with proxy servers.

4
00:00:13.572 --> 00:00:16.777
Proxy servers are another system
that helps secure networks.

5
00:00:16.777 --> 00:00:20.902
The definition of a proxy server is
a server that fulfills the request of

6
00:00:20.902 --> 00:00:23.735
a client by forwarding
them on to other servers.

7
00:00:23.735 --> 00:00:27.684
The proxy server is a dedicated server
that sits between the internet and

8
00:00:27.684 --> 00:00:29.053
the rest of the network.

9
00:00:29.053 --> 00:00:32.486
When a request to connect to
the network comes in from the internet,

10
00:00:32.486 --> 00:00:35.931
the proxy server will determine if
the connection request is safe.

11
00:00:35.931 --> 00:00:39.658
The proxy server is a public IP address
that is different from the rest

12
00:00:39.658 --> 00:00:41.018
of the private network.

13
00:00:41.018 --> 00:00:46.665
This hides the private network's IP address
from malicious actors on the internet and

14
00:00:46.665 --> 00:00:48.424
adds a layer of security.

15
00:00:49.424 --> 00:00:50.756
Let's examine how this
will work with an example.

16
00:00:50.756 --> 00:00:56.690
When a client receives an HTTPS response,
they will notice a distorted IP address or

17
00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:02.390
no IP address rather than the real IP
address of the organization's web server.

18
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:07.152
A proxy server can also be used to block
unsafe websites that users aren't allowed

19
00:01:07.152 --> 00:01:09.649
to access on an organization's network.

20
00:01:09.649 --> 00:01:14.020
A proxy server uses temporary
memory to store data that's

21
00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.331
regularly requested by external servers.

22
00:01:17.331 --> 00:01:21.967
This way, it doesn't have to fetch
data from an organization's internal

23
00:01:21.967 --> 00:01:23.338
servers every time.

24
00:01:23.338 --> 00:01:27.397
This enhances security by reducing
contact with the internal server.

25
00:01:28.397 --> 00:01:31.673
There are different types of proxy
servers that support network security.

26
00:01:31.673 --> 00:01:34.665
This is important for
security analysts who monitor

27
00:01:34.665 --> 00:01:39.296
traffic from various proxy servers and
may need to know what purpose they serve.

28
00:01:39.296 --> 00:01:41.918
Let's explore some different
types of proxy servers.

29
00:01:41.918 --> 00:01:44.131
A forward proxy server regulates and

30
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:47.062
restricts a person with
access to the internet.

31
00:01:47.062 --> 00:01:52.455
The goal is to hide a user's IP address
and approve all outgoing requests.

32
00:01:52.455 --> 00:01:54.481
In the context of an organization,

33
00:01:54.481 --> 00:01:59.278
a forward proxy server receives outgoing
traffic from an employee, approves it, and

34
00:01:59.278 --> 00:02:02.464
then forwards it on to
the destination on the internet.

35
00:02:02.464 --> 00:02:04.488
A reverse proxy server regulates and

36
00:02:04.488 --> 00:02:07.498
restricts the internet access
to an internal server.

37
00:02:07.498 --> 00:02:11.475
The goal is to accept traffic from
external parties, approve it, and

38
00:02:11.475 --> 00:02:13.648
forward it to the internal servers.

39
00:02:13.648 --> 00:02:17.113
This setup is useful for
protecting internal web servers containing

40
00:02:17.113 --> 00:02:20.768
confidential data from exposing their
IP address to external parties.

41
00:02:20.768 --> 00:02:24.028
An email proxy server is
another valuable security tool.

42
00:02:24.028 --> 00:02:28.256
It filters spam email by verifying
whether a sender's address was forged.

43
00:02:28.256 --> 00:02:31.947
This reduces the risk of phishing
attacks that impersonate people known to

44
00:02:31.947 --> 00:02:32.951
the organization.

45
00:02:33.951 --> 00:02:35.759
Let's talk about a real world
example of an email proxy.

46
00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:39.629
Several years ago when I was working
at a large U.S. broadband ISP,

47
00:02:39.629 --> 00:02:43.455
we used a proxy server to implement
multiple layers of anti-spam filtering

48
00:02:43.455 --> 00:02:45.996
before a message was allowed in for
delivery.

49
00:02:45.996 --> 00:02:50.266
It ended up tagging around
95% of messages as spam.

50
00:02:50.266 --> 00:02:53.052
The proxy servers would've
allowed us to filter and

51
00:02:53.052 --> 00:02:57.593
then scale those filters without
impacting the underlying email platform.

52
00:02:58.593 --> 00:03:02.712
Proxy servers play an important part in
network security by filtering incoming and

53
00:03:02.712 --> 00:03:06.236
outgoing traffic and
staying alert to network attacks.

54
00:03:06.236 --> 00:03:10.676
These devices add a layer of protection
from the unsecured public network that we call

55
00:03:10.676 --> 00:03:11.521
the internet.
