00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.760
In this video, we're going to

2
00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.665
discuss how virtual
private networks,

3
00:00:04.665 --> 00:00:07.635
or VPNs, add security
to your network.

4
00:00:07.635 --> 00:00:09.090
When you connect
to the internet,

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.950
your internet service
provider receives

6
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.150
your network's requests and

7
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.400
forwards it to the correct
destination server.

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:15.780
But your internet requests

9
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.370
include your private
information.

10
00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:19.409
That means if the traffic
gets intercepted,

11
00:00:19.409 --> 00:00:21.885
someone could potentially
connect your internet activity

12
00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:23.250
with your physical location

13
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.885
and your personal information.

14
00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:26.430
This includes some information

15
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:27.525
that you want to keep private,

16
00:00:27.525 --> 00:00:29.850
like bank accounts and
credit card numbers.

17
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.575
A virtual private network,

18
00:00:31.575 --> 00:00:33.300
also known as a VPN,

19
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.370
is a network security
service that changes

20
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.440
your public IP address and hides

21
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.870
your virtual location so
that you can keep your data

22
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:41.230
private when you're
using a public

23
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:42.780
network like the internet.

24
00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.990
VPNs also encrypt
your data as it

25
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.260
travels across the internet
to preserve confidentiality.

26
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.940
A VPN service performs

27
00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:52.145
encapsulation on your
data in transit.

28
00:00:52.145 --> 00:00:54.170
Encapsulation is a
process performed

29
00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.000
by a VPN service that protects

30
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.170
your data by wrapping

31
00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.660
sensitive data in
other data packets.

32
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:02.570
Previously, you learned how
the MAC and IP address of

33
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.250
the destination
device is contained

34
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.350
in the header and footer
of a data packet.

35
00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:08.510
This is a security
threat because it shows

36
00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.585
the IP and virtual location
of your private network.

37
00:01:11.585 --> 00:01:14.150
You could secure a data
packet by encrypting

38
00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.655
it to make sure your information
can't be deciphered,

39
00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:18.710
but then network routers
won't be able to read

40
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.370
the IP and MAC address to
know where to send it to.

41
00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.180
This means you won't
be able to connect to

42
00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.210
the internet site or the
service that you want.

43
00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.060
Encapsulation
solves this problem

44
00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.330
while still maintaining
your privacy.

45
00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:34.430
VPN services encrypt
your data packets and

46
00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:36.950
encapsulate them in
other data packets

47
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.315
that the routers can read.

48
00:01:38.315 --> 00:01:40.040
This allows your
network requests

49
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.555
to reach their destination,

50
00:01:41.555 --> 00:01:43.595
but still encrypts
your personal data

51
00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:46.090
so it's unreadable
while in transit.

52
00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.770
A VPN also uses an
encrypted tunnel

53
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.695
between your device
and the VPN server.

54
00:01:51.695 --> 00:01:55.175
The encryption is unhackable
without a cryptographic key,

55
00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:57.280
so no one can access your data.

56
00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.900
VPN services are
simple and offer

57
00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.665
significant protection while
you're on the internet.

58
00:02:02.665 --> 00:02:03.910
With a VPN,

59
00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:06.480
you have the added assurance
that your data is encrypted, and

60
00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:07.550
your IP address and

61
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.790
virtual location are unreadable
to malicious actors.
