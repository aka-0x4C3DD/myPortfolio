2
00:00:04.402 --> 00:00:05.349
My name is Antara,

3
00:00:05.349 --> 00:00:08.797
I work on the Enterprise Infrastructure
Protection Team at Google.

4
00:00:08.797 --> 00:00:11.654
And our main job
responsibility is to protect

5
00:00:11.654 --> 00:00:15.800
the infrastructure that all
the amazing Google products run on.

6
00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.134
I didn't start with a background in
computers, and I did my undergrad

7
00:00:19.134 --> 00:00:22.634
in electronics and communication,
which is far away from computers.

8
00:00:22.634 --> 00:00:26.668
I took up the challenge to actually
pivot into computers with my first job.

9
00:00:26.668 --> 00:00:31.068
That actually led me to explore
the security world even more.

10
00:00:31.068 --> 00:00:35.478
And that's how it led to doing my masters
in security, getting expertise in that

11
00:00:35.478 --> 00:00:38.706
area and then come to Google
as a security engineer.

12
00:00:38.706 --> 00:00:42.568
A typical day in the life of
an entry-level network security engineer

13
00:00:42.568 --> 00:00:44.736
would start with solving a problem.

14
00:00:44.736 --> 00:00:49.381
Maybe you're trying to debug, why is
this particular endpoint flooded with so

15
00:00:49.381 --> 00:00:50.342
much traffic?

16
00:00:50.342 --> 00:00:52.560
Or why is this endpoint
actually slowing down?

17
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.306
And you would start with, okay,
let me get to the endpoint.

18
00:00:55.306 --> 00:00:57.724
Let me capture some traffic
on the endpoint and

19
00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:01.674
see what kind of traffic is coming in and
going out through this endpoint.

20
00:01:01.674 --> 00:01:05.466
So I would typically go back,
think about the problem during lunch.

21
00:01:05.466 --> 00:01:07.236
Sometimes things would click.

22
00:01:07.236 --> 00:01:10.858
When you're thinking you might not have
thought about a problem from a different

23
00:01:10.858 --> 00:01:13.848
perspective, you might want to
actually see how it looks like.

24
00:01:13.848 --> 00:01:16.766
So you would go about maybe
doing a lab recreate.

25
00:01:16.766 --> 00:01:20.412
Let me connect these endpoints and
let me try to reproduce the issue.

26
00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:23.046
You might see some things in the lab
recreate that you might have not

27
00:01:23.046 --> 00:01:23.612
thought of.

28
00:01:23.612 --> 00:01:27.757
And you might need to actually consult
with experts from different domains who

29
00:01:27.757 --> 00:01:29.656
might know better about this area.

30
00:01:29.656 --> 00:01:32.187
Get their view on what the problem is,
analyze,

31
00:01:32.187 --> 00:01:34.496
show them everything that you have done.

32
00:01:34.496 --> 00:01:38.032
You might get your solution
just by talking to people.

33
00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:41.824
It's a pretty busy day, but
it's also a very fun day.

34
00:01:41.824 --> 00:01:45.650
It's like solving puzzles all the time,
which is pretty exciting.

35
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:49.922
Some of the best practices in network
security that I've learned are,

36
00:01:49.922 --> 00:01:52.538
don't try to always reinvent the wheel.

37
00:01:52.538 --> 00:01:54.267
There are certain protocols,

38
00:01:54.267 --> 00:01:57.724
there are certain algorithms
that have been tried, tested,

39
00:01:57.724 --> 00:02:02.424
analyzed, and they have been deemed secure
for being used in network security.

40
00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:06.017
The time that you spend on reinventing
the wheel is not going to give you

41
00:02:06.017 --> 00:02:07.596
the benefits that you need.

42
00:02:07.596 --> 00:02:12.563
So it's always good to think about
the unsolved challenges instead of

43
00:02:12.563 --> 00:02:16.444
trying to solve the same
problem in a different way.

44
00:02:16.444 --> 00:02:20.866
I feel cybersecurity is actually a great
field to get into right now, because,

45
00:02:20.866 --> 00:02:25.426
as you see, we are in this information
age where tech is exponentially growing.

46
00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:28.564
Just getting into this field is just
going to be exciting because there

47
00:02:28.564 --> 00:02:30.886
are amazing new challenges
coming up in this field.
