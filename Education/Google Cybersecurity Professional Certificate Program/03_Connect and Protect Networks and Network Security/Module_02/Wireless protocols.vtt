00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.230
So far, you've learned about

2
00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:03.985
a variety of network protocols,

3
00:00:03.985 --> 00:00:07.370
including communication
protocols like TCP/IP.

4
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:09.785
Now we're going to
go more in depth

5
00:00:09.785 --> 00:00:11.905
into a class of
communication protocols

6
00:00:11.905 --> 00:00:15.500
called the IEEE802.11.

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.015
IEEE802.11, commonly
known as Wi-Fi,

8
00:00:20.015 --> 00:00:21.580
is a set of standards
that define

9
00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.795
communications for
wireless LANs.

10
00:00:23.795 --> 00:00:25.510
IEEE stands for

11
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:28.600
the Institute of Electrical
and Electronics Engineers,

12
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:32.140
which is an organization that
maintains Wi-Fi standards,

13
00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:34.660
and 802.11 is a suite of

14
00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.775
protocols used in
wireless communications.

15
00:00:38.775 --> 00:00:40.090
Wi-Fi protocols have adapted

16
00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.644
over the years to become
more secure and reliable

17
00:00:42.644 --> 00:00:44.090
to provide the same level of

18
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.445
security as a wired connection.

19
00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.330
In 2004,

20
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.870
a security protocol called
the Wi-Fi Protected Access,

21
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.910
or WPA, was introduced.

22
00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.240
WPA is a wireless
security protocol

23
00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.265
for devices to connect
to the internet.

24
00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:00.920
Since then, WPA has evolved

25
00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.415
into newer versions,
like WPA2 and WPA3,

26
00:01:04.415 --> 00:01:06.680
which include further
security improvements,

27
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.620
like more advanced encryption.

28
00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:10.430
As a security analyst,

29
00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:12.830
you might be responsible
for making sure that

30
00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.025
the wireless connections in
your organization are secure.

31
00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:19.140
Let's learn more about
security measures.
