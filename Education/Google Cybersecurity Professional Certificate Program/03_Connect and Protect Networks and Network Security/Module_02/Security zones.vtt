00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.300
In this section, we'll
discuss a type of

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.345
network security feature
called a security zone.

3
00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:08.700
Security zones are a
segment of a network

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.310
that protects the internal
network from the internet.

5
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.365
They are a part of a
security technique

6
00:00:13.365 --> 00:00:15.780
called network segmentation

7
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.285
that divides the network
into segments.

8
00:00:18.285 --> 00:00:19.560
Each network segment has

9
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:22.845
its own access permissions
and security rules.

10
00:00:22.845 --> 00:00:25.320
Security zones control who can

11
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.375
access different
segments of a network.

12
00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:31.530
Security zones act as a
barrier to internal networks,

13
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:33.885
maintain privacy within
corporate groups,

14
00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:37.110
and prevent issues from
spreading to the whole network.

15
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.630
One example of network
segmentation is

16
00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.405
a hotel that offers
free public Wi-Fi.

17
00:00:42.405 --> 00:00:45.590
The unsecured guest network
is kept separate from

18
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.040
another encrypted network
used by the hotel staff.

19
00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.500
Additionally, an organization's

20
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.670
network can be divided into

21
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.980
subnetworks, or subnets, to

22
00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.025
maintain privacy for each
department in a organization.

23
00:00:58.025 --> 00:01:00.380
For instance, at a university,

24
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.180
there may be a faculty subnet

25
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.190
and a separate students subnet.

26
00:01:04.190 --> 00:01:07.115
If there is contamination
on the student's subnet,

27
00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:09.680
network administrators
can isolate it and

28
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.680
keep the rest of the network
free from contamination.

29
00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:15.050
An organization's network
is classified into

30
00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.155
two types of security
zones. First,

31
00:01:18.155 --> 00:01:19.835
there's the uncontrolled zone,

32
00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:21.590
which is any network outside of

33
00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:24.425
the organization's control,
like the internet.

34
00:01:24.425 --> 00:01:26.540
Then, there's the
controlled zone,

35
00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:28.160
which is a subnet that protects

36
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.205
the internal network from
the uncontrolled zone.

37
00:01:31.205 --> 00:01:32.960
There are several types of

38
00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.830
networks within the
controlled zone.

39
00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:37.655
On the outer layer is
the demilitarized zone,

40
00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:39.500
or DMZ, which contains

41
00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.130
public-facing services that
can access the internet.

42
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.895
This includes web servers,

43
00:01:43.895 --> 00:01:46.220
proxy servers that host
websites for the public,

44
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.915
and DNS servers that provide

45
00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:50.090
IP addresses for internet users.

46
00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.010
It also includes email and file

47
00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:54.445
servers that handle
external communications.

48
00:01:54.445 --> 00:01:56.300
The DMZ acts as

49
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.420
a network perimeter to
the internal network.

50
00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:01.880
The internal network
contains private servers and

51
00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:04.600
data that the organization
needs to protect.

52
00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.560
Inside the internal network is

53
00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:08.840
another zone called
the restricted zone.

54
00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:10.910
The restricted zone protects

55
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:13.550
highly confidential
information that is only

56
00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:16.345
accessible to employees
with certain privileges.

57
00:02:17.345 --> 00:02:19.265
Now, let's try to picture
these security zones.

58
00:02:19.265 --> 00:02:22.220
Ideally, the DMZ is
situated between

59
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.720
two firewalls. One of them

60
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.240
filters traffic outside the DMZ,

61
00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.635
and one of them filters traffic

62
00:02:27.635 --> 00:02:29.525
entering the internal network.

63
00:02:29.525 --> 00:02:31.700
This protects the
internal network

64
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:33.410
with several lines of defense.

65
00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.150
If there's a restricted zone,

66
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.710
that too would be protected with

67
00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.870
another firewall. This way,

68
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:40.160
attacks that penetrate into

69
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.960
the DMZ network cannot spread
to the internal network,

70
00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.240
and attacks that penetrate

71
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:47.185
the internal network cannot
access the restricted zone.

72
00:02:47.185 --> 00:02:49.040
As a security analyst,

73
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.065
you may be responsible
for regulating

74
00:02:51.065 --> 00:02:53.860
access control policies
on these firewalls.

75
00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.480
Security teams can
control traffic reaching

76
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.610
the DMZ and the internal network

77
00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:01.160
by restricting IPs and ports.

78
00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.740
For example, an analyst
may ensure that

79
00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:06.140
only HTTPS traffic is

80
00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:08.690
allowed to access web
servers in the DMZ.

81
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:10.280
Security zones are

82
00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.425
an important part of
securing networks,

83
00:03:12.425 --> 00:03:14.855
especially in large
organizations.

84
00:03:14.855 --> 00:03:16.610
Understanding how
they are used is

85
00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.650
essential for all
security analysts.

86
00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:23.220
Coming up, we'll learn about
securing internal networks.
