00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:16.753
First, we discussed common network
protocols like TCP, ARP, HTTPS, and DNS.

5
00:00:16.753 --> 00:00:19.864
And then we covered how
virtual private networks, or

6
00:00:19.864 --> 00:00:23.344
VPNs, can be used to maintain
privacy on a public network.

7
00:00:23.344 --> 00:00:26.922
Finally, we explored how firewalls,
security zones, and

8
00:00:26.922 --> 00:00:31.110
proxy servers help to secure
network infrastructure.

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.361
Overall, network operations is a vast

10
00:00:36.361 --> 00:00:42.061
protocols, and techniques that help
networks run smoothly and securely.
