00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:03.795
Welcome back! In this video,

2
00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:06.630
we're going to discuss some
resources that are available

3
00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.310
directly through
the shell and can

4
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.485
help you while working in Linux.

5
00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:13.080
One of the great
things about Linux is

6
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.780
that you can get help right
through the command line.

7
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:19.860
The first command that can
help you in this way is: man.

8
00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.020
man displays information on

9
00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.300
other commands and
how they work.

10
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.720
The name of this command
comes from the word manual.

11
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.690
Let's examine this
more closely by using

12
00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:34.095
man to get information
about the usermod command.

13
00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:37.980
After man, we type the
name of this command.

14
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.070
The information that man

15
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:42.860
returns includes a
general description.

16
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:44.899
It also contains information

17
00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:47.425
about each of usermod's options.

18
00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:50.640
For example, the
option -d can be

19
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:53.929
added to usermod to change
a user's home directory.

20
00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:56.000
man provides a lot
of information,

21
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.530
but sometimes we just need

22
00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.845
a quick reference on
what a command does.

23
00:00:59.845 --> 00:01:02.835
In that case, you use whatis.

24
00:01:02.835 --> 00:01:04.910
whatis displays a description

25
00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:07.580
of a command on a single line.

26
00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.025
Let's say you heard
a co-worker

27
00:01:10.025 --> 00:01:12.035
mention a command like tail.

28
00:01:12.035 --> 00:01:14.570
You've never heard of
this command before,

29
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.945
but you can find
out what it does.

30
00:01:16.945 --> 00:01:18.570
Simply use the command,

31
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.670
whatis tail, and learn that

32
00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:23.145
it outputs the last
part of files.

33
00:01:24.145 --> 00:01:26.720
Sometimes we might not even
know what command to look up.

34
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.330
This is where
apropos can help us.

35
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.585
apropos searches the
manual page descriptions

36
00:01:32.585 --> 00:01:35.350
for a specified string.
Let's try it out.

37
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.800
Let's say you have a task that

38
00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.525
requires you to
change a password,

39
00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:40.535
but you're not quite
sure how to do this.

40
00:01:40.535 --> 00:01:43.805
If we use the apropos command
with the string password,

41
00:01:43.805 --> 00:01:45.320
this will display a large number

42
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:46.945
of commands with that word.

43
00:01:46.945 --> 00:01:48.200
This helps somewhat,

44
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.915
but it still may be difficult
to find what we need.

45
00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:52.730
But we can filter this by adding

46
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:55.420
the -a option and
an additional string.

47
00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.840
This option will return

48
00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.585
only the commands that
contain both strings.

49
00:01:59.585 --> 00:02:02.450
In our case, since we want
to change the password,

50
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.974
let's look for commands with
both: change and password.

51
00:02:05.974 --> 00:02:07.625
Now, the output has been

52
00:02:07.625 --> 00:02:09.830
limited to the most
relevant commands.

53
00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:11.720
These commands make it a lot

54
00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.315
easier to navigate the
Linux command line.

55
00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:15.920
As a new analyst,

56
00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.440
you won't have all the
answers all the time,

57
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.380
but you can learn
where to find them.
