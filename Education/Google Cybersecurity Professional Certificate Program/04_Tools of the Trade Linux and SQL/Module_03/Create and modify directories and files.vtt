1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.565
Let's make some branches!

2
00:00:02.565 --> 00:00:04.165
What do I mean by that?

3
00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:06.450
Well, in a previous video,

4
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.310
we discussed root
directories and

5
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.260
how other subdirectories branch

6
00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.850
off of the root directory.

7
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.170
Let's think again about

8
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.765
the file directory
system as a tree.

9
00:00:15.765 --> 00:00:19.230
The subdirectories are
the branches of the tree.

10
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.780
They're all connected
from the same root

11
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.510
but can grow to make
a complex tree.

12
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.310
In this video, we'll create

13
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.580
directories and files and
learn how to modify them.

14
00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:31.650
When it comes to
working with data in

15
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.170
security, organization is key.

16
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:36.900
If we know where
information is located,

17
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.505
it makes it easier to detect

18
00:00:38.505 --> 00:00:41.065
issues and keep
information safe.

19
00:00:41.065 --> 00:00:42.635
In a previous video,

20
00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:45.935
we've already discussed
navigating between directories,

21
00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:47.270
but let's take a moment to

22
00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:50.120
examine directories
more closely.

23
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.130
It's possible you're
familiar with the concept

24
00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.340
of folders for
organizing information.

25
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.225
In Linux, we have directories.

26
00:00:57.225 --> 00:01:01.515
Directories help organize
files and subdirectories.

27
00:01:01.515 --> 00:01:05.040
For example, within a
directory for reports,

28
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.815
an analyst may need to
create two subdirectories:

29
00:01:07.815 --> 00:01:10.780
one for drafts and one
for final reports.

30
00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.245
Now that we know why
we need directories,

31
00:01:13.245 --> 00:01:14.480
let's take a look at

32
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.040
some essential
Linux commands for

33
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.230
managing directories and files.

34
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:20.750
First, let's take note of

35
00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:23.510
commands for creating and
removing directories.

36
00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.910
The mkdir command
creates a new directory.

37
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.670
In contrast, rmdir removes
or deletes a directory.

38
00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.260
A helpful feature
of this command is

39
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.670
its built-in warning
that lets you

40
00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:39.560
know a directory is not empty.

41
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.135
This saves you from
accidentally deleting files.

42
00:01:43.135 --> 00:01:44.990
Next, you'll use

43
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:47.480
other commands for creating
and removing files.

44
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.030
The touch command
creates a new file,

45
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:54.430
and then the rm command
removes or deletes a file.

46
00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:57.320
And last, we have our
commands for copying

47
00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.065
and moving files or directories.

48
00:02:00.065 --> 00:02:05.119
The mv command moves a file
or directory to new location,

49
00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:10.480
and cp copies a file or
directory into a new location.

50
00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.775
Now, we're ready to try
out these commands.

51
00:02:13.775 --> 00:02:17.195
First, let's use
the pwd command,

52
00:02:17.195 --> 00:02:19.940
and then let's display the
names of the files and

53
00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.870
directories in the analyst
directory with the ls command.

54
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.760
Imagine that we no longer need

55
00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.380
the oldreports directory that

56
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.570
appears among the file contents.

57
00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.585
Let's take a look at
how to remove it.

58
00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:36.470
We input the rmdir command
and follow it with

59
00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:40.190
the name of the directory we
want to remove: oldreports.

60
00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:42.965
We can use the ls
command to confirm that

61
00:02:42.965 --> 00:02:44.870
oldreports has been deleted

62
00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.330
and no longer appears
among the contents.

63
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.015
Now, let's make another change.

64
00:02:50.015 --> 00:02:53.500
We want a new directory
for drafts of reports.

65
00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.410
We need to use the command: mkdir

66
00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.305
and specify a name for
this directory: drafts.

67
00:03:00.305 --> 00:03:02.180
If we input ls again,

68
00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:04.160
we'll notice the new
directory drafts

69
00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:07.685
included among the contents
of the analyst directory.

70
00:03:07.685 --> 00:03:10.355
Let's change into
this new directory

71
00:03:10.355 --> 00:03:13.860
by entering: cd drafts.

72
00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.520
If we run ls,

73
00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:18.485
it doesn't return any output,

74
00:03:18.485 --> 00:03:22.180
indicating that this
directory is currently empty.

75
00:03:22.180 --> 00:03:25.510
But next, we'll add
some files to it.

76
00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.070
Let's say we want to
draft new reports on

77
00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:30.920
recently installed
email and OS patches.

78
00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.510
To create these files,

79
00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:36.990
we input: touch email_patches.txt

80
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:42.360
and then: touch OS_patches.txt.

81
00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:48.380
Running ls indicates that

82
00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.604
these files are now in
the drafts directory.

83
00:03:51.604 --> 00:03:54.905
What if we realize that we
only need a new report on

84
00:03:54.905 --> 00:03:56.660
OS patches and we want

85
00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.910
to delete the email
patches report?

86
00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.900
To do this, we input the rm
command and specify the file

87
00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:07.920
to delete as: email_patches.txt.

88
00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.685
Running ls confirms
that it's been deleted.

89
00:04:11.685 --> 00:04:15.500
Now, let's focus on our commands
for moving and copying.

90
00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.710
We realized that we have
a file called email

91
00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.630
policy in the reports folder

92
00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:22.720
that is currently
in draft format.

93
00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:26.375
We want to move it into the
newly created drafts folder.

94
00:04:26.375 --> 00:04:28.685
To do this, we need to change

95
00:04:28.685 --> 00:04:32.310
into the directory that
currently has that file.

96
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.710
Running ls in that directory
indicates that it contains

97
00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:44.010
several files, including
email_policy.txt.

98
00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:46.575
Then to move that file,

99
00:04:46.575 --> 00:04:50.400
we'll enter the mv command
followed by two arguments.

100
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:52.905
The first argument

101
00:04:52.905 --> 00:04:56.025
after mv identifies
the file to be moved.

102
00:04:56.025 --> 00:05:00.245
The second argument
indicates where to move it.

103
00:05:00.245 --> 00:05:02.540
If we change directories into

104
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.520
drafts and then
display its contents,

105
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.325
we'll notice that the
email policy file

106
00:05:07.325 --> 00:05:09.830
has been moved to
this directory.

107
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:12.505
We'll change back into reports.

108
00:05:12.505 --> 00:05:15.155
Displaying the file
contents confirms that

109
00:05:15.155 --> 00:05:19.050
email_policy is no longer there.

110
00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.460
Okay, one more thing.
vulnerabilities.txt is

111
00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:28.580
a file that we want to keep
in the reports directory.

112
00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:31.459
But since it affects
an upcoming project,

113
00:05:31.459 --> 00:05:35.105
we also want to copy it into
the project's directory.

114
00:05:35.105 --> 00:05:39.095
Since we're already in the
directory that has this file,

115
00:05:39.095 --> 00:05:41.000
we'll use the cp command to

116
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.160
copy it into the
projects directory.

117
00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.750
Notice that the first argument

118
00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.490
indicates which file to copy,

119
00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:48.500
and the second argument provides

120
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.145
the path to the directory
that it will be copied into.

121
00:05:52.145 --> 00:05:54.315
When we press Enter,

122
00:05:54.315 --> 00:05:57.350
this copies the
vulnerabilities file into

123
00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.420
the projects
directory while also

124
00:05:59.420 --> 00:06:01.870
leaving the original
within reports.

125
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.020
Isn't it cool what we can
do with these commands?

126
00:06:05.020 --> 00:06:05.420
Now, let's focus on

127
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:08.840
one more concept related
to modifying files.

128
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:11.150
In addition to using commands,

129
00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:14.615
you can also use applications
to help you edit files.

130
00:06:14.615 --> 00:06:16.400
As a security analyst,

131
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:18.650
file editors are
often necessary for

132
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:21.935
your daily tasks, like
writing or editing reports.

133
00:06:21.935 --> 00:06:24.575
A popular file editor is nano.

134
00:06:24.575 --> 00:06:26.494
It's good for beginners.

135
00:06:26.494 --> 00:06:29.900
You can access this tool
through the nano command.

136
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.570
Let's get familiar
with nano together.

137
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.130
We'll add a title to

138
00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:39.090
our new draft report:
OS_patches.txt.

139
00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:41.750
First, we change into

140
00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:44.095
the directory
containing that file,

141
00:06:44.095 --> 00:06:46.535
then we input nano

142
00:06:46.535 --> 00:06:48.560
followed by the name
of the file we want

143
00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:52.790
to edit: OS_patches.txt.

144
00:06:52.790 --> 00:06:57.680
This brings up the nano file
editor with that file open.

145
00:06:57.680 --> 00:06:59.900
For now, we'll just enter

146
00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:03.875
the title OS Patches by
typing this into the editor.

147
00:07:03.875 --> 00:07:05.450
We need to save this before

148
00:07:05.450 --> 00:07:07.670
returning to the command
line, and to do so,

149
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:09.170
we press Ctrl+O

150
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:13.655
and then enter to save it
with the current file name.

151
00:07:13.655 --> 00:07:17.940
Then to exit, we
press Ctrl+X.

152
00:07:19.680 --> 00:07:21.025
Great work!

153
00:07:21.025 --> 00:07:23.240
We've covered a lot
of topics here—from

154
00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.730
creating and removing
directories and files

155
00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:27.230
to copying or moving them,

156
00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:28.730
and just now,

157
00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:30.620
we've added editing files.

158
00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.230
You're well on your way to
learning Linux commands!
