2
00:00:04.106 --> 00:00:06.785
My name is Damar,
I'm a security engineer here at Google.

3
00:00:06.785 --> 00:00:09.428
I've always wanted to get into
cybersecurity since I was a kid.

4
00:00:09.428 --> 00:00:12.847
A lot of the cartoons I watched, they
had like floppy disks or flash drives, and

5
00:00:12.847 --> 00:00:15.522
they would put that in the computer and
kind of like cause havoc.

6
00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:18.250
[LAUGH] So
I always thought that was really cool.

7
00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:21.231
I've had quite a bit of jobs
before coming to Google.

8
00:00:21.231 --> 00:00:25.121
I originally started out making
smoothies at Jamba Juice.

9
00:00:25.121 --> 00:00:28.502
I got my first IT technological
kind of job at Geek Squad and

10
00:00:28.502 --> 00:00:31.958
then eventually came here and
became a security engineer.

11
00:00:31.958 --> 00:00:36.036
My advice to people trying to get into
cybersecurity is it may be a lot easier

12
00:00:36.036 --> 00:00:36.957
than you think.

13
00:00:36.957 --> 00:00:39.722
[LAUGH] It definitely was
a lot easier than I thought.

14
00:00:39.722 --> 00:00:42.351
Something that I learned jumping in myself
is that you're not going to be able to

15
00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:43.524
learn everything all at once, and

16
00:00:43.524 --> 00:00:45.397
you're not going to need to
know everything all at once.

17
00:00:45.397 --> 00:00:49.992
Linux is very important
because it's broadly

18
00:00:49.992 --> 00:00:54.005
used across pretty much every company.

19
00:00:54.005 --> 00:00:57.160
You may use Linux to curate logs.

20
00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:01.576
It's a very common practice
you may also use Linux to set up

21
00:01:01.576 --> 00:01:06.260
bash jobs that will help with
routine tasks within Linux.

22
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.624
I first got interested in learning
Linux from the Jurassic Park movie.

23
00:01:10.624 --> 00:01:15.643
There's a scene in the movie where they
need to reactivate the electrical doors,

24
00:01:15.643 --> 00:01:18.861
and they have to use a UNIX
operating system to do so.

25
00:01:18.861 --> 00:01:24.321
So later on, I learned what UNIX was and
how Linux came from it,

26
00:01:24.321 --> 00:01:28.007
and it inspired me to learn more about Linux.

27
00:01:28.007 --> 00:01:32.045
The best advice I can give someone
that's trying to learn Linux and

28
00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:36.830
Linux commands is, don't get discouraged
by any small hiccups that come up.

29
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.910
Just keep with it.

30
00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:38.525
Stick with it.

31
00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:41.405
Think of it as when you first
learned to swim, right,

32
00:01:41.405 --> 00:01:43.585
you probably weren't that great at it.

33
00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:48.046
[LAUGH] It was frustrating, and
you were probably a little scared, but

34
00:01:48.046 --> 00:01:51.989
you're stuck with it and
I hope that you're able to swim now.

35
00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:56.789
[LAUGH] There are a plethora of
support resources when learning Linux.

36
00:01:56.789 --> 00:02:01.042
One good example is the discussion
forum in the certificate course.

37
00:02:01.042 --> 00:02:06.017
Another avenue of support for learning
Linux is just googling answers using

38
00:02:06.017 --> 00:02:09.380
Stack Overflow,
maybe even making a Reddit post.

39
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:10.944
I love working in cybersecurity.

40
00:02:10.944 --> 00:02:13.903
It's pretty satisfying to know that me and
my team and

41
00:02:13.903 --> 00:02:18.311
then like all the other security teams
here at Google are helping protect people

42
00:02:18.311 --> 00:02:21.036
online from things they
may not even know about.

43
00:02:21.036 --> 00:02:21.536
