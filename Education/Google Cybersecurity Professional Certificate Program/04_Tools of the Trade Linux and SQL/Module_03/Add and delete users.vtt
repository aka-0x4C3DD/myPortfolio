00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.150
Welcome back! In
this video, we are

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:05.790
going to discuss adding
and deleting users.

3
00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.075
This is related to the
concept of authentication.

4
00:00:09.075 --> 00:00:12.240
Authentication is the
process of a user

5
00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.740
proving that they
are who they say

6
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.585
they are in the system.

7
00:00:16.585 --> 00:00:17.250
Just like in a
physical building,

8
00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.690
not all users should
be allowed in.

9
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.890
Not all users should get
access to the system.

10
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:25.070
But we also want to
make sure everyone

11
00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.730
who should have access
to the system has it.

12
00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.345
That's why we need to add users.

13
00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:32.210
New users can be new to

14
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.895
the organization
or new to a group.

15
00:00:34.895 --> 00:00:36.965
This could be related
to a change in

16
00:00:36.965 --> 00:00:39.560
organizational structure
or simply a directive

17
00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:41.525
from management to move someone.

18
00:00:42.525 --> 00:00:44.810
And also, when users leave
the organization,

19
00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:46.415
they need to be deleted.

20
00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:47.840
They should no longer have

21
00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:50.015
access to any part
of the system.

22
00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.905
Or if they simply
changed groups,

23
00:00:51.905 --> 00:00:53.480
they should be
deleted from groups

24
00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:55.615
that they are no
longer a part of.

25
00:00:56.615 --> 00:00:57.560
Now that we've
sorted out why it's

26
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.465
important to add
and delete users,

27
00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:02.660
let's discuss a different
type of user, the root user.

28
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.880
A root user, or superuser,

29
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:09.040
is a user with elevated
privileges to modify the system.

30
00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:11.670
Regular users have limitations,

31
00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.240
where the root does not.

32
00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.230
Individuals who need to perform

33
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:19.490
specific tasks can be temporarily
added as root users.

34
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.475
Root users can create, modify,

35
00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:25.910
or delete any file
and run any program.

36
00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.130
Only root users or accounts with

37
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:31.090
root privileges
can add new users.

38
00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.175
So you may be wondering how
you become a superuser.

39
00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:37.430
Well, one way is logging
in as the root user,

40
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.560
but running commands
as the root user is

41
00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.340
considered to be bad
practice when using Linux.

42
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:44.210
Why is running commands as

43
00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:46.810
a root user
potentially problematic?

44
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:48.755
The first problem
with logging in

45
00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:51.080
as root is the security risks.

46
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.410
Malicious actors will try
to breach the root account.

47
00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.440
Since it's the most powerful
account, to stay safe,

48
00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.445
the root account should
have logins disabled.

49
00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:02.810
Another problem
is that it's very

50
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.320
easy to make
irreversible mistakes.

51
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.065
It's very easy to type the
wrong command in the CLI,

52
00:02:09.065 --> 00:02:11.120
and if you're running
as the root user,

53
00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.330
you run a higher risk of
making an irreversible mistake,

54
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.615
such as permanently
deleting a directory.

55
00:02:16.615 --> 00:02:19.820
Finally, there's the
concern of accountability.

56
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.625
In a multi-user
environment like Linux,

57
00:02:22.625 --> 00:02:24.520
there are many users.

58
00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:26.600
If a user is running as root,

59
00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.170
there is no way to track
who exactly ran a command.

60
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.150
One solution to help solve
this problem is sudo.

61
00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:36.920
sudo is a command that
temporarily grants

62
00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.920
elevated permissions
to specific users.

63
00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.690
This provides more of

64
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.060
a controlled approach
compared to root,

65
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.005
which runs every command
with root privileges.

66
00:02:47.005 --> 00:02:48.440
sudo solves lots of

67
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.735
problems associated
with running as root.

68
00:02:51.735 --> 00:02:53.480
sudo comes from super-user-do

69
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.760
and lets you execute commands as

70
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.740
an elevated user without having

71
00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.980
to sign in and out
of another account.

72
00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.090
Running sudo will
prompt you to enter

73
00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:05.155
the password for the user
you're currently logged in as.

74
00:03:05.155 --> 00:03:09.020
Not all users on a system
can become a superuser.

75
00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.930
Users must be granted
sudo access through

76
00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.325
a configuration file
called the sudoers file.

77
00:03:16.325 --> 00:03:17.515
Now that we've
learned about sudo,

78
00:03:17.515 --> 00:03:19.220
let's learn how we
can use it with

79
00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.380
another command to add users.

80
00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:23.960
This command is useradd.

81
00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:27.445
useradd adds a user
to the system.

82
00:03:27.445 --> 00:03:29.240
Only root or users with

83
00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:32.435
sudo privileges can
use a useradd command.

84
00:03:32.435 --> 00:03:34.340
Let's look at a specific example

85
00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.170
in which we need to add a user.

86
00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:38.840
We'll imagine a new
representative is joining

87
00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.640
the sales department
and will be given

88
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:43.130
the username of salesrep7.

89
00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:46.085
We're tasked with adding
them to the system.

90
00:03:47.085 --> 00:03:48.310
Let's try adding the new user.

91
00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:51.155
First, we need to use
the sudo command,

92
00:03:51.155 --> 00:03:53.425
followed by the useradd command,

93
00:03:53.425 --> 00:03:56.525
and then last, the username
we want to add,

94
00:03:56.525 --> 00:03:58.835
in this case, salesrep7.

95
00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:01.235
This command doesn't display
anything on the screen.

96
00:04:01.235 --> 00:04:03.200
But since we get
a new Bash cursor

97
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.775
and not an error message,

98
00:04:04.775 --> 00:04:06.200
we can feel confident that

99
00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.985
the command worked successfully.

100
00:04:07.985 --> 00:04:11.090
If it didn't, an error
message would have appeared.

101
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:12.890
Sometimes an error
has to do with

102
00:04:12.890 --> 00:04:15.575
something simple like
misspelling useradd.

103
00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:19.555
Or, it might be because we
didn't have sudo privileges.

104
00:04:20.555 --> 00:04:22.245
Now let's learn how
to do the opposite.

105
00:04:22.245 --> 00:04:25.700
Let's learn how to delete
a user with userdel.

106
00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.580
userdel deletes a
user from the system.

107
00:04:28.580 --> 00:04:31.310
Similarly, we need root
permissions that we'll

108
00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:34.550
access through sudo
to use userdel.

109
00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:37.860
Let's go back to our example
of the user we added.

110
00:04:37.860 --> 00:04:39.575
Let's imagine two months later,

111
00:04:39.575 --> 00:04:41.270
the sales representative that we just

112
00:04:41.270 --> 00:04:43.780
added to the system
leaves the company.

113
00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:47.465
That user should no longer
have access to the system.

114
00:04:47.465 --> 00:04:50.155
Let's delete that
user from the system.

115
00:04:51.155 --> 00:04:53.640
Again, the sudo
command is used first,

116
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.100
then we add the userdel command.

117
00:04:56.100 --> 00:05:00.130
Last, we add the name of
the user we want to delete.

118
00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:03.230
Again, we know it ran
successfully because

119
00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:06.865
there is a new Bash cursor
and not an error message.

120
00:05:07.865 --> 00:05:09.500
Now, we've covered
how to add and delete

121
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:12.515
users and how these
actions require sudo.

122
00:05:12.515 --> 00:05:16.100
When using sudo, we have
to use our best judgment.

123
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.590
These special
privileges must be used

124
00:05:18.590 --> 00:05:22.020
responsibly to ensure
a secure system.
