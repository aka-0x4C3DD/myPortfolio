00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:04.230
Learning to communicate in
a new way can be exciting.

2
00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.970
Maybe you've learned
a new language

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.545
and can remember this feeling.

4
00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:09.960
Perhaps a lot of us share
this excitement with

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.035
young children as they are
expanding their vocabulary.

6
00:00:13.035 --> 00:00:16.410
Others, including me, remember
a sense of wonder when we

7
00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:18.225
first used a specialized language

8
00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:20.280
to communicate with
their computer.

9
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.300
In this section, we'll
continue to learn more about

10
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.560
Linux and how to

11
00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:27.380
communicate with the
OS through its shell.

12
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.660
You'll utilize
the command line

13
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.630
to communicate with the OS.

14
00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.170
You'll learn how to input

15
00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:35.240
commands in the shell
and learn about some of

16
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.010
the core Linux
commands that you'll

17
00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.370
use as a security analyst.

18
00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.600
Specifically, this includes

19
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.990
navigating and managing
the file system.

20
00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:45.320
You'll also focus on

21
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.900
authenticating and
authorizing users.

22
00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.790
This means you'll be able to

23
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.440
use a command line to add and

24
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.060
delete users from the system and

25
00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.055
to control what they
have access to.

26
00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:58.165
Finally, there's
always more to learn.

27
00:00:58.165 --> 00:01:00.380
We'll cover accessing
resources that

28
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:02.915
support learning
new Linux commands.

29
00:01:03.915 --> 00:01:05.720
I remember when I first
learned about the command line

30
00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.555
and was shocked at the
capabilities it provided.

31
00:01:08.555 --> 00:01:09.890
I didn't need to click through

32
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.185
multiple screens
to get tasks done.

33
00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:15.335
Although it took some practice
and time to get used to,

34
00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:18.260
it has been one of the
biggest tools at my disposal.

35
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.150
After this section, you'll have

36
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.040
a practical
experience in an area

37
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.150
important to the work of

38
00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.150
a security analyst:
using Linux commands.
