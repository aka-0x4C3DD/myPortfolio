00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:02.060
We did it!

2
00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.940
What a great section of learning!

3
00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.112
The best thing is that
we did this together and

4
00:00:06.112 --> 00:00:07.790
covered some very useful topics.

5
00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.263
Let's recap this section's lessons.

6
00:00:10.263 --> 00:00:11.347
As a security analyst,

7
00:00:11.347 --> 00:00:15.640
it's important that you understand
the systems that you're working with.

8
00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:19.451
Understanding computer basics will help
you do your job more effectively and

9
00:00:19.451 --> 00:00:20.230
efficiently.

10
00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:23.740
In this section,
we covered common operating systems.

11
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:27.510
We also discussed the main
functions of an operating system.

12
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.480
Importantly, you learned about the
relationship between operating systems,

13
00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:33.000
applications, and hardware.

14
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.100
It was nice to learn how they
flow together like an orchestra.

15
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.132
In addition, you learned about
the differences between the graphical user

16
00:00:40.132 --> 00:00:42.490
interface and the command-line interface.

17
00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.640
Understanding the command-line interface
will be very important for your work.

18
00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.990
I enjoyed exploring the world
of operating systems with you.

19
00:00:49.990 --> 00:00:54.019
Knowing how operating systems work is
an important step in preparing for

20
00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:55.950
a position as a security analyst.

21
00:00:55.950 --> 00:00:58.090
You're doing great!

22
00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.860
Let's keep moving forward
with this program.

23
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:01.976
In the next section,

24
00:01:01.976 --> 00:01:05.081
we'll focus specifically on
the Linux operating system.
