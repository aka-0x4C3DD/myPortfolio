00:00:04.634 --> 00:00:09.499
My name is Ellen and I am a security
engineering manager at Google focused

3
00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:11.664
in on how Google uses the cloud.

4
00:00:11.664 --> 00:00:15.668
Cybersecurity wasn't a field when
I got started in technology,

5
00:00:15.668 --> 00:00:17.352
something I came to later.

6
00:00:17.352 --> 00:00:22.146
I got started in technology when I
was working retail at a poster store.

7
00:00:22.146 --> 00:00:27.479
And we needed to build a website and my
feet hurt and I really needed to sit down.

8
00:00:27.479 --> 00:00:30.124
And so I asked friends to
teach me how to do HTML so

9
00:00:30.124 --> 00:00:33.976
I could sit down while working and
I could let my blisters have a rest.

10
00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:37.952
While I was at the poster store, one of
our customers worked at a start up and

11
00:00:37.952 --> 00:00:40.984
used to get employee photos framed and
they asked them for

12
00:00:40.984 --> 00:00:44.619
feedback on my website, and
they ended up giving me an internship.

13
00:00:44.619 --> 00:00:48.043
One of the specialties that I
ended up having was API design or

14
00:00:48.043 --> 00:00:52.500
designing the interface by which
a developer communicates with the machine.

15
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.764
As part of that, I got into a job where
I was designing a miniature version of

16
00:00:56.764 --> 00:00:59.542
an operating system for
security technology and

17
00:00:59.542 --> 00:01:01.915
started learning security from there.

18
00:01:01.915 --> 00:01:05.390
Most of the people I know from cyber
security, especially in the early days,

19
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.627
do not have a degree at all.

20
00:01:06.627 --> 00:01:10.741
Or if they do, they have a degree like I
do in something like philosophy or poetry.

21
00:01:10.741 --> 00:01:14.619
Almost everyone learned on
their own by experimenting,

22
00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.050
by talking to people, by reading.

23
00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:19.830
And so I would say no technical
background is required.

24
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:24.266
And in fact, having a background where
you're used to being out in the real world

25
00:01:24.266 --> 00:01:27.205
can sometimes make cybersecurity
make more sense and

26
00:01:27.205 --> 00:01:29.377
help you make more balanced choices.

27
00:01:29.377 --> 00:01:32.902
In almost all areas, there is
a security community that you can find.

28
00:01:32.902 --> 00:01:37.600
Figure out where they are, look for local
conferences, start talking to people.

29
00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:40.392
It's a lot more fun to learn
that way than it is in a vacuum.

30
00:01:40.392 --> 00:01:44.581
I've found that most people if you come to
them and say, hey, you're really good at

31
00:01:44.581 --> 00:01:48.537
this thing, would you mind if I bought you
a coffee and you showed me how to do it?

32
00:01:48.537 --> 00:01:50.785
That they'll always pretty much say yes.

33
00:01:50.785 --> 00:01:55.332
The advice I give to people who don't have
technical backgrounds, the first one is,

34
00:01:55.332 --> 00:01:57.557
I wouldn't be afraid of the technology.

35
00:01:57.557 --> 00:02:01.381
It can seem like only somebody with
a computer science degree could ever

36
00:02:01.381 --> 00:02:03.995
understand things, but
these concepts,

37
00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:06.813
these technologies
are understandable by anyone.

38
00:02:06.813 --> 00:02:10.440
And so never let the fact that you might
not have a technical background get

39
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.742
in the way, just pick an area that
interests you and start diving in.

40
00:02:13.742 --> 00:02:16.882
And as long as you're curious, and as
long as you find it interesting, you'll,

41
00:02:16.882 --> 00:02:18.120
you'll learn the technology.
