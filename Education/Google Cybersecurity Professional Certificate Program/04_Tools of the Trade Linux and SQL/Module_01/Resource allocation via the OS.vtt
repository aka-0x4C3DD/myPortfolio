00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.250
Now we're ready to discuss

2
00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:04.380
a different aspect of
your operating system.

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:05.880
Not only does the OS

4
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.085
interact with other
parts of your computer,

5
00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:09.510
but it's also responsible for

6
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.790
managing the resources
of the system.

7
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.165
This is a big task that requires
a lot of balance to make

8
00:00:15.165 --> 00:00:16.470
sure all the resources of

9
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.915
the computer are
used efficiently.

10
00:00:18.915 --> 00:00:21.435
Think of this like the
concept of energy.

11
00:00:21.435 --> 00:00:24.330
A person needs energy to
complete different tasks.

12
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.415
Some tasks need more energy,

13
00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:28.110
while others require less.

14
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.450
For example, going for a run

15
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.255
requires more energy
than watching TV.

16
00:00:33.255 --> 00:00:36.420
A computer's OS also needs
to make sure that it

17
00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.500
has enough energy to

18
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.625
function correctly
for certain tasks.

19
00:00:39.625 --> 00:00:42.620
Running an antivirus scan
on your computer will use

20
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.860
more energy than using the
calculator application.

21
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.225
Imagine your computer
is an orchestra.

22
00:00:48.225 --> 00:00:50.405
Many different
instruments like violins,

23
00:00:50.405 --> 00:00:53.465
drums, and trumpets are
all part of the orchestra.

24
00:00:53.465 --> 00:00:54.710
An orchestra also has

25
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.205
a conductor to direct
the flow of the music.

26
00:00:57.205 --> 00:01:00.140
In a computer, the
OS is the conductor.

27
00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:03.500
The OS handles resource and
memory management to ensure

28
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:04.880
the limited capacity of

29
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.135
the computer system is used
where it's needed most.

30
00:01:08.135 --> 00:01:10.535
A variety of programs, tasks,

31
00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:13.010
and processes are
constantly competing for

32
00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.655
the resources of the central
processing unit, or CPU.

33
00:01:16.655 --> 00:01:19.430
They all have their own
reasons why they need memory,

34
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.425
storage, and
input/output bandwidth.

35
00:01:22.425 --> 00:01:25.225
The OS is responsible
for ensuring that

36
00:01:25.225 --> 00:01:28.990
each program is allocating
and de-allocating resources.

37
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.240
All this occurs in
your computer at

38
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.355
the same time so that your
system functions efficiently.

39
00:01:34.355 --> 00:01:36.570
Much of this is hidden
from you as a user.

40
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.580
But, your task manager

41
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:40.200
will list all of

42
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.300
the tasks that are
being processed,

43
00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.555
along with their
memory and CPU usage.

44
00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:46.910
As an analyst, it's
helpful to know

45
00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:49.430
where a system's
resources are used.

46
00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:52.430
Understanding usage of
resources can help you respond

47
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.750
to an incident and troubleshoot

48
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.560
applications in the system.

49
00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:58.760
For example, if a computer
is running slowly,

50
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.365
an analyst might discover

51
00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:03.775
it's allocating
resources to malware.

52
00:02:03.775 --> 00:02:04.425
A basic understanding of how

53
00:02:04.425 --> 00:02:06.330
operating systems
work will help you

54
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.265
better understand
the security skills

55
00:02:08.265 --> 00:02:13.020
you will learn later
in this program.
