00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.870
Now that you've learned the
inner workings of computers,

2
00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:05.370
let's discuss how users and

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:07.860
operating systems
communicate with each other.

4
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.560
So far, you've learned
that a computer has

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:13.755
an operating system,
hardware, and applications.

6
00:00:13.755 --> 00:00:15.570
Remember, the operating system

7
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.555
communicates with the
hardware to execute tasks.

8
00:00:18.555 --> 00:00:21.720
In this video, you'll
learn how the

9
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.970
user—that's you—interacts with

10
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:25.410
the operating system in order to

11
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.270
send tasks to the hardware.

12
00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:28.950
The user communicates with

13
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:31.980
the operating system
via an interface.

14
00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:35.090
A user interface is a
program that allows

15
00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.395
a user to control the functions
of the operating system.

16
00:00:38.395 --> 00:00:41.870
Two user interfaces
that we'll discuss are

17
00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:43.790
the graphical user interface, or

18
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.975
GUI, and the command-line
interface, or CLI.

19
00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:51.265
Let's cover these
interfaces in more detail.

20
00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:54.470
A GUI is a user interface
that uses icons on

21
00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:57.320
the screen to manage different
tasks on the computer.

22
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.330
Most operating systems can be

23
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.685
used with a graphical
user interface.

24
00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:04.655
If you've used a personal
computer or a cell phone,

25
00:01:04.655 --> 00:01:07.165
you have experienced
operating a GUI.

26
00:01:07.165 --> 00:01:09.795
Most GUIs include
these components:

27
00:01:09.795 --> 00:01:12.185
a start menu with
program groups,

28
00:01:12.185 --> 00:01:14.405
a task bar for
launching programs,

29
00:01:14.405 --> 00:01:17.410
and a desktop with
icons and shortcuts.

30
00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:19.220
All these components help you

31
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.150
communicate with the
OS to execute tasks.

32
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.900
In addition to
clicking on icons,

33
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.270
when you use a GUI,

34
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.010
you can also search for files or

35
00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.500
applications from
the start menu.

36
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.990
You just have to remember
the icon or name

37
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.905
of the program to
activate an application.

38
00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:39.030
Now let's discuss the
command-line interface.

39
00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.800
In comparison, the command-line
interface, or CLI,

40
00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.960
is a text-based user interface

41
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.965
that uses commands to
interact with the computer.

42
00:01:47.965 --> 00:01:50.180
These commands communicate with

43
00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:51.710
the operating system and execute

44
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:53.765
tasks like opening programs.

45
00:01:53.765 --> 00:01:55.640
The command-line interface is

46
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.065
a much different structure

47
00:01:57.065 --> 00:01:59.095
than the graphical
user interface.

48
00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:00.995
When you use the CLI,

49
00:02:00.995 --> 00:02:03.245
you'll immediately
notice a difference.

50
00:02:03.245 --> 00:02:06.020
There are no icons or
graphics on the screen.

51
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.510
The command-line interface
looks similar to

52
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:11.380
lines of code using
certain text languages.

53
00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.470
A CLI is more flexible and
more powerful than a GUI.

54
00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:17.284
Think about using a CLI

55
00:02:17.284 --> 00:02:19.310
like creating whatever
meal you'd like

56
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:21.770
from ingredients bought
at a grocery store.

57
00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.200
This gives you a
lot of control and

58
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.920
customization about what
you're going to eat.

59
00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:28.475
In comparison,

60
00:02:28.475 --> 00:02:31.625
using a GUI is more like
ordering food from a restaurant.

61
00:02:31.625 --> 00:02:34.475
You can only order
what's on the menu.

62
00:02:34.475 --> 00:02:37.580
If you want both a
noodle dish and pizza,

63
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.535
but the first restaurant
you go to only has pizza,

64
00:02:40.535 --> 00:02:42.335
you'll have to go to
another restaurant

65
00:02:42.335 --> 00:02:43.975
to order the noodles.

66
00:02:43.975 --> 00:02:46.235
With a graphical user interface,

67
00:02:46.235 --> 00:02:48.505
you must do one task at a time.

68
00:02:48.505 --> 00:02:51.500
But the command-line interface
allows for customization,

69
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.440
which lets you complete
multiple tasks simultaneously.

70
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.330
For example, imagine you

71
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.130
have a folder with
hundreds of files of

72
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:00.200
different file types,
and you need to

73
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.200
move only the JPEG
files to a new folder.

74
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.790
Think about how slow and

75
00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.010
tedious this would be
as you use a GUI to

76
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.690
find each JPEG file in

77
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.195
this folder and move
it into the new one.

78
00:03:11.195 --> 00:03:13.910
On the other hand, the
CLI would allow you to

79
00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.180
streamline this process
and move them all at once.

80
00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:19.460
As you can see, there are

81
00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:20.660
very big differences in

82
00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.700
these two types of
user interfaces.

83
00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.245
As a security analyst,

84
00:03:24.245 --> 00:03:27.115
some of your work may involve
the command-line interface.

85
00:03:27.115 --> 00:03:28.700
When analyzing logs or

86
00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:30.905
authenticating and
authorizing users,

87
00:03:30.905 --> 00:03:32.840
security analysts commonly use

88
00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.570
a CLI in their everyday work.

89
00:03:35.570 --> 00:03:39.530
In this video, we discussed two
types of user interfaces.

90
00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:41.180
You learned that you already have

91
00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:44.285
experience using a
graphical user interface,

92
00:03:44.285 --> 00:03:48.325
as most personal computers
and cell phones use a GUI.

93
00:03:48.325 --> 00:03:51.755
You were introduced to the
command-line interface.

94
00:03:51.755 --> 00:03:53.225
Later in the program,

95
00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:56.090
you'll learn how to use
a CLI in Linux and how

96
00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.545
relevant it is to your daily
work as a security analyst.

97
00:03:59.545 --> 00:04:01.310
You'll get practical experience

98
00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:04.920
communicating through the
command line. Pretty exciting, right?
