Hi, I'm Kim.

2
00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:08.265
I'm a technical program
manager at Google.

3
00:00:08.265 --> 00:00:09.660
I'm currently working in

4
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.020
the security, mergers,
and acquisitions team.

5
00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.145
Where I work with other
companies that we purchase,

6
00:00:14.145 --> 00:00:16.695
and I help them integrate
into the Google environment.

7
00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:18.960
I've held multiple roles
before getting into

8
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.660
cybersecurity and
even technology.

9
00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.480
I first started working
as a restaurant worker,

10
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.940
and then I became
an English Tutor

11
00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:29.325
for international students
at my local college.

12
00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:31.545
After doing multiple
internships,

13
00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:33.610
and graduating from university,

14
00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.080
I had my first opportunity
to work in technology,

15
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.030
and that's where my
interests in technology,

16
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.195
and eventually
cybersecurity began.

17
00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:42.230
I want to tell everyone
with any type of

18
00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:44.720
background that you can
get into cybersecurity.

19
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.090
If you're interested in
protecting information,

20
00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.000
if you're interested in
protecting people in the future,

21
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.710
security is there for you.

22
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.600
There are so many different
roles you can do,

23
00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.330
and all of the skills
that you have now,

24
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.950
and that you've gathered
previously,

25
00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:59.854
can be applicable
within security.

26
00:00:59.854 --> 00:01:01.460
The skill that I use the most is

27
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.955
connecting with people every day.

28
00:01:03.955 --> 00:01:05.645
I can't get anything done

29
00:01:05.645 --> 00:01:08.075
unless I connect with
them the right way.

30
00:01:08.075 --> 00:01:10.110
So that's actually the
biggest skill I

31
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.990
lean on the most
working in security.

32
00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:13.160
A piece of advice I would give

33
00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.450
for someone new starting in

34
00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.680
the cybersecurity field
is to keep an open mind.

35
00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.810
I started out with a
degree in business,

36
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.060
so I didn't even feel like I was

37
00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:25.900
technical enough to
be where I am today.

38
00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.745
And before that, all
of my experiences

39
00:01:28.745 --> 00:01:30.545
were either restaurant work,

40
00:01:30.545 --> 00:01:32.210
or marketing work, or
just something that

41
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.645
felt like it was
unrelated to technology.

42
00:01:34.645 --> 00:01:37.880
But all of that helped
me and motivated me to

43
00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.530
actually kind of get my feet more
wet into technology,

44
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:44.375
and then eventually security.

45
00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:45.845
And before I knew it,

46
00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:47.180
that self-doubt was really

47
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:49.010
replaced with more of a support

48
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:50.600
from my peers and

49
00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.760
respect from other people
that I've worked with.
