00:00:01.115 --> 00:00:06.122
Devices like computers, smartphones, and
tablets all have operating systems.

2
00:00:06.122 --> 00:00:09.221
If you've used a desktop or
laptop computer,

3
00:00:09.221 --> 00:00:14.225
you may have used the Windows or
MacOs operating systems. Smartphones and

4
00:00:14.225 --> 00:00:18.451
tablets run on mobile operating
systems like Android and iOS.

5
00:00:18.451 --> 00:00:21.777
Another popular operating system is Linux.

6
00:00:21.777 --> 00:00:24.189
Linux is used in the security industry,

7
00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:29.228
and as a security professional, it's likely
that you'll interact with the Linux OS.

8
00:00:30.228 --> 00:00:31.663
So what exactly is an operating system?

9
00:00:31.663 --> 00:00:35.397
It's the interface between
the computer hardware and the user.

10
00:00:35.397 --> 00:00:40.061
The operating system, or the OS as it's
commonly called, is responsible for

11
00:00:40.061 --> 00:00:45.096
making the computer run as efficiently as
possible while also making it easy to use.

12
00:00:45.096 --> 00:00:47.278
Hardware may be another new term.

13
00:00:47.278 --> 00:00:51.048
Hardware refers to the physical
components of a computer.

14
00:00:52.048 --> 00:00:55.551
The OS interface that we now rely on
every day is something that early

15
00:00:55.551 --> 00:00:57.296
computers didn't have.

16
00:00:57.296 --> 00:01:01.695
In the 1950s the biggest challenge with
early computers was the amount of time

17
00:01:01.695 --> 00:01:05.775
it took to run a computer program. At
the time, computers could not run multiple

18
00:01:05.775 --> 00:01:07.326
programs simultaneously.

19
00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:11.174
Instead, people had to wait for
a program to finish running,

20
00:01:11.174 --> 00:01:14.137
reset the computer, and
load up the new program.

21
00:01:14.137 --> 00:01:16.730
Imagine having to turn
your computer on and

22
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:19.611
off each time you had to
open a new application!

23
00:01:19.611 --> 00:01:24.019
It would take a long time to complete
a simple task like sending an email.

24
00:01:24.019 --> 00:01:26.907
Since then,
operating systems have evolved, and

25
00:01:26.907 --> 00:01:30.298
we no longer have to worry
about wasting time in this way.

26
00:01:30.298 --> 00:01:32.827
Thanks to operating systems and
their evolution,

27
00:01:32.827 --> 00:01:34.776
today's computers run efficiently.

28
00:01:34.776 --> 00:01:37.133
They run multiple applications at once, and

29
00:01:37.133 --> 00:01:41.133
they also access external devices
like printers, keyboards, and mice.

30
00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:44.889
Another reason why operating systems
are important is that they help humans and

31
00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.860
computers communicate with each other.

32
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:52.125
Computers communicate in a language called
binary, which consists of 0s and 1s.

33
00:01:52.125 --> 00:01:57.239
The OS provides an interface to bridge
this communication gap between the user

34
00:01:57.239 --> 00:02:02.441
and the computer, allowing you to interact
with the computer in complex ways.

35
00:02:03.441 --> 00:02:06.561
Operating systems are critical for
the use of computers. Likewise,

36
00:02:06.561 --> 00:02:10.256
OS security is also critical for
the security of a computer.

37
00:02:10.256 --> 00:02:15.327
This involves securing files,
data access, and user authentication to

38
00:02:15.327 --> 00:02:21.003
help protect and prevent against threats
such as viruses, worms, and malware.

39
00:02:21.003 --> 00:02:23.792
Knowing how operating
systems work is essential for

40
00:02:23.792 --> 00:02:26.397
completing different
security related tasks.

41
00:02:26.397 --> 00:02:31.322
For example, as a security analyst,
you may be responsible for configuring and

42
00:02:31.322 --> 00:02:34.880
maintaining the security of
a system by managing access.

43
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.069
You may also be responsible for
managing and configuring firewalls,

44
00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:42.886
setting security policies,
enabling virus protection, and

45
00:02:42.886 --> 00:02:47.764
performing auditing, accounting, and
logging to detect unusual behavior.

46
00:02:47.764 --> 00:02:51.540
All these tasks require a deep
understanding of operating systems, and

47
00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:56.028
as we continue this course, we'll explore
operating systems in greater detail.
