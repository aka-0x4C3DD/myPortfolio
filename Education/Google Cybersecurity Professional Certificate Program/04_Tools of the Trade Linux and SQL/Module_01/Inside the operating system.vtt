00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.990
Previously, you learned about
what operating systems are.

2
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.330
Now, let's discuss
how they work.

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.700
In this video, you'll
learn what happens with

4
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.890
an operating system, or OS,

5
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.485
when someone uses a
computer for a task.

6
00:00:14.485 --> 00:00:15.570
Think about when
someone drives a car.

7
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.100
They push the gas pedal
and the car moves forward.

8
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.770
They don't need to
pay attention to

9
00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.990
all the mechanics that
allow the car to move.

10
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:24.300
Just like a car can't
work without its engine,

11
00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.940
a computer can't work without
its operating system.

12
00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:28.695
The job of an OS is to help

13
00:00:28.695 --> 00:00:30.795
other computer programs
run efficiently.

14
00:00:30.795 --> 00:00:32.670
The OS does this by taking care of

15
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.980
all the messy details
related to controlling,

16
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.515
the computer's hardware,
so you don't have to.

17
00:00:38.515 --> 00:00:39.200
First, let's see what

18
00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.150
happens when you turn
on the computer.

19
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.295
When you press the power button,

20
00:00:43.295 --> 00:00:45.590
you're interacting
with the hardware.

21
00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.060
This boots the computer and

22
00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:48.815
brings up the operating system.

23
00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:50.330
Booting the computer means that

24
00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.090
a special microchip called
a BIOS is activated.

25
00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.655
On many computers
built after 2007,

26
00:00:55.655 --> 00:00:57.850
the chip was replaced
by the UEFI.

27
00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.250
Both BIOS and UEFI contain
booting instructions that are

28
00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.260
responsible for loading
a special program

29
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.835
called the bootloader.

30
00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:06.740
Then, the bootloader is

31
00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.080
responsible for starting
the operating system.

32
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.510
Just like that, your
computer is on.

33
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.235
As a security analyst,

34
00:01:13.235 --> 00:01:16.340
understanding these processes
can be helpful for you.

35
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.260
Vulnerabilities can occur in

36
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.510
something like a
booting process.

37
00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:22.490
Often, the BIOS is not

38
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.455
scanned by the
antivirus software,

39
00:01:24.455 --> 00:01:26.995
so it can be vulnerable
to malware infection.

40
00:01:26.995 --> 00:01:29.990
Now, that you learned how to
boot the operating system,

41
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.240
let's look at how
you and all users

42
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.090
communicate with the
system to complete a task.

43
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.835
The process starts
with you, the user.

44
00:01:37.835 --> 00:01:41.335
And to complete tasks, you use
applications on your computer.

45
00:01:41.335 --> 00:01:43.130
An application is a program

46
00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.220
that performs a specific task.

47
00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.240
When you do this,
the application

48
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.640
sends your request to
the operating system.

49
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.910
From there, the operating
system interprets this request

50
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:54.875
and directs it to the
appropriate component

51
00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:56.570
of the computer's hardware.

52
00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:58.415
In the previous video,

53
00:01:58.415 --> 00:02:00.440
we learned that the
hardware consists of

54
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:03.190
all the physical components
of the computer.

55
00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.000
The hardware will also send

56
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.445
information back to
the operating system.

57
00:02:07.445 --> 00:02:10.385
And this in turn is sent
back to the application.

58
00:02:11.385 --> 00:02:13.250
Let's give a simple
overview of how this works

59
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.850
when you want to use the
calculator on your computer.

60
00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.650
You use your mouse to click on

61
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.245
the calculator application
on your computer.

62
00:02:21.245 --> 00:02:23.795
When you type in the number
you want to calculate,

63
00:02:23.795 --> 00:02:26.555
the application communicates
with the operating system.

64
00:02:26.555 --> 00:02:28.430
Your operating system then sends

65
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.905
a calculation to a
component of the hardware,

66
00:02:30.905 --> 00:02:34.240
the central processing
unit, or CPU.

67
00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.870
Once the hardware does the work

68
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.520
of determining the final number,

69
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.025
it sends the answer back
to your operating system.

70
00:02:40.025 --> 00:02:43.310
Then, it can be displayed in
your calculator application.

71
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.290
Understanding this process is

72
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.570
helpful when investigating
security events.

73
00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:49.460
Security analysts
should be able to

74
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.590
trace back through
this process flow

75
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:54.445
to analyze where a security
event could have occurred.

76
00:02:55.445 --> 00:02:56.030
Just like a mechanic needs to

77
00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.280
understand the inner
workings of a car

78
00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.840
more than an average driver,

79
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.880
recognizing how
operating systems

80
00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:05.460
work is important knowledge
for a security analyst.
