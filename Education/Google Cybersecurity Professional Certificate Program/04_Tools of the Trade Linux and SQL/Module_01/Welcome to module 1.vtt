00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.810
How many times a week
do you use a computer?

2
00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.255
For some of us, the
answer might be "a lot"!

3
00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:07.920
They are incredible
machines that

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:09.390
let us do everything from using

5
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.600
specialized applications when
completing a task at work

6
00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.750
to sending emails to loved
ones in a distant place.

7
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.670
Have you ever thought
about how computers

8
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.930
can do all of this?

9
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.210
Well, that's where
operating systems come in.

10
00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:23.010
In this section,
we'll learn about

11
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.990
common operating systems,
and we'll explore

12
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.060
the main functions of
an operating system.

13
00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:29.325
Then, we'll learn the
relationship between

14
00:00:29.325 --> 00:00:32.355
operating systems,
applications, and hardware.

15
00:00:32.355 --> 00:00:33.865
Finally, we'll compare

16
00:00:33.865 --> 00:00:36.930
graphical user interfaces
and command-line interfaces.

17
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.330
The command-line
interface will be

18
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.645
an essential part of your
job as a security analyst.

19
00:00:41.645 --> 00:00:43.910
Understanding
operating systems is

20
00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.705
an important foundation for
your career in security.

21
00:00:46.705 --> 00:00:50.580
There's so much to
explore. Let's begin.
