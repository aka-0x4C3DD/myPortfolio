00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:06.020
Welcome back! In this video, we're
going to discuss the Linux shell.

2
00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.018
This part of the Linux architecture
is where the action will happen for

3
00:00:10.018 --> 00:00:11.585
you as a security analyst.

4
00:00:11.585 --> 00:00:15.726
We introduced the shell with other
components of the Linux OS earlier,

5
00:00:15.726 --> 00:00:19.400
but let's take a deeper look at
what the shell is and what it does.

6
00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:21.330
The shell is the command-line interpreter.

7
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.634
That means it helps you communicate
with the operating system through

8
00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:25.890
the command line.

9
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.530
Previously, we discussed
a command-line interface.

10
00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.780
This is essentially the shell.

11
00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.152
The shell provides the command-line
interface for you to interact with the OS.

12
00:00:37.152 --> 00:00:41.570
To tell the OS what to do, you enter
commands into this interface.

13
00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.570
A command is an instruction telling
the computer to do something.

14
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:49.059
The shell communicates with
the kernel to execute these commands.

15
00:00:50.059 --> 00:00:52.505
Earlier, we discussed how
the operating system helps humans and

16
00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:54.950
computers speak with each other.

17
00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.561
The shell is the part of the OS
that allows you to do this.

18
00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.929
Think of this as a very helpful language
interpreter between you and your system.

19
00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:05.615
Since you do not speak
computer language or binary,

20
00:01:05.615 --> 00:01:08.410
you can't directly
communicate with your system.

21
00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:10.915
This is where the shell
comes in to help you.

22
00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:14.179
Your OS doesn't need the shell for
most of its work, but

23
00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:17.799
it is an interface between you and
what your system can offer.

24
00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:22.070
It allows you to perform math,
run tests, and execute applications.

25
00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:25.647
More importantly, it allows you
to combine these operations and

26
00:01:25.647 --> 00:01:27.734
connect applications to each other

27
00:01:27.734 --> 00:01:30.940
to perform complex and automated tasks.

28
00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:33.352
Just as there are many
Linux distributions,

29
00:01:33.352 --> 00:01:35.643
there are many different types of shells.

30
00:01:35.643 --> 00:01:39.098
We'll primarily focus on
the Bash shell in this course.

31
00:01:39.098 --> 00:01:41.201
Let's continue to learn
more about the shell.
