00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.150
We've made it to the
end of this section.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:04.425
Great work!

3
00:00:04.425 --> 00:00:06.765
Let's recap what
you've just completed.

4
00:00:07.765 --> 00:00:08.640
In this section, you learned

5
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.515
about the Linux
operating system.

6
00:00:10.515 --> 00:00:13.080
We examined the
architecture of Linux.

7
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.610
In our exploration of

8
00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:16.560
the different
distributions of Linux, we

9
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.640
discussed some of the most

10
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:20.280
widely used distros in security.

11
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.655
You were introduced to
KALI LINUXâ„¢, Ubuntu,

12
00:00:23.655 --> 00:00:26.925
Parrot, Red Hat, and
CentOS distributions.

13
00:00:26.925 --> 00:00:29.670
Finally, you learned
about the shell and

14
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:31.080
its role as an interpreter

15
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.330
between the user and
operating system.

16
00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.930
Congratulations! You're doing

17
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.855
great, and we have more
useful topics to come.

18
00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:40.865
In the next part of the program,

19
00:00:40.865 --> 00:00:43.430
you'll learn specific
commands to use within

20
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:44.990
the shell while working as

21
00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.730
a security analyst.
Let's continue on.
