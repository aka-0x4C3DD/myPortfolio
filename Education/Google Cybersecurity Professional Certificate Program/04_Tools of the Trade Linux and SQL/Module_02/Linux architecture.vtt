00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.880
Let me start with a
quick question that may

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.725
seem unrelated to security.

3
00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:06.765
Do you have a favorite building?

4
00:00:06.765 --> 00:00:08.370
And what is it about

5
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.400
its architecture that
impresses you the most?

6
00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.425
The windows? The
structure of the walls?

7
00:00:13.425 --> 00:00:16.290
Just like buildings,
operating systems also have

8
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.940
an architecture
and are made up of

9
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.910
discrete components that work
together to form the whole.

10
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.385
In this video, we're
going to look at

11
00:00:23.385 --> 00:00:26.310
all the components that
together make up Linux.

12
00:00:27.310 --> 00:00:29.745
The components of Linux include
the user, applications,

13
00:00:29.745 --> 00:00:32.565
the shell, the Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard,

14
00:00:32.565 --> 00:00:34.575
the kernel, and the hardware.

15
00:00:34.575 --> 00:00:36.060
Don't worryâ€”we'll go into

16
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.100
these components one
by one together.

17
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.170
First, you are the user.

18
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.030
The user is the person
interacting with the computer.

19
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.955
In Linux, you're
the first element

20
00:00:46.955 --> 00:00:49.685
to the architecture of
the operating system.

21
00:00:49.685 --> 00:00:51.700
You're initiating the tasks or

22
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.130
commands that the OS
is going to execute.

23
00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:56.430
Linux is a multi-user system.

24
00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.940
This means that more
than one user can

25
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:01.610
use the system's resources
at the same time.

26
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.965
The second element
of the architecture

27
00:01:03.965 --> 00:01:06.745
is the applications
within a system.

28
00:01:06.745 --> 00:01:08.630
An application is a program

29
00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.505
that performs a specific task,

30
00:01:10.505 --> 00:01:13.225
such as a word processor
or a calculator.

31
00:01:13.225 --> 00:01:15.755
You might hear the
word "applications"

32
00:01:15.755 --> 00:01:17.965
and "programs" used
interchangeably.

33
00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:19.505
As an example,

34
00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:21.380
one popular Linux
application that

35
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.690
we'll learn more
about later is Nano.

36
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.570
Nano is a text editor.

37
00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.990
This simple application helps

38
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.445
you keep notes on the screen.

39
00:01:28.445 --> 00:01:30.200
Linux applications are commonly

40
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.945
distributed through
package managers.

41
00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:35.320
We'll learn more about
this process later.

42
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:37.310
The next component
in the architecture

43
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:38.780
of Linux is the shell.

44
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:40.985
This is an important
element because

45
00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:43.400
it is how you will
communicate with the system.

46
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.680
The shell is a command
line interpreter.

47
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.425
It processes commands
and outputs the results.

48
00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:49.975
This might sound familiar.

49
00:01:49.975 --> 00:01:51.830
Previously, we learned

50
00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:53.915
about the two types
of user interfaces:

51
00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:55.835
the GUI and the CLI.

52
00:01:55.835 --> 00:01:58.190
You can think of
the shell as a CLI.

53
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:00.320
Another element of
the architecture of

54
00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.870
Linux is the Filesystem
Hierarchy Standard,

55
00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:04.790
or FHS. It's

56
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:08.270
the component of the Linux
OS that organizes data.

57
00:02:08.270 --> 00:02:10.190
An easy way for
you to think about

58
00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.000
the FHS is to think about it
as a filing cabinet of data.

59
00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.080
The FHS is how data is
stored in a system.

60
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.600
It's a way to organize
data so that it can be

61
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.560
found when the data is
accessed by the system.

62
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:25.260
That brings us to the kernel.

63
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.780
The kernel is a component of

64
00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:30.095
the Linux OS that manages
processes and memory.

65
00:02:30.095 --> 00:02:32.480
The kernel communicates
with the hardware

66
00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:34.805
to execute the commands
sent by the shell.

67
00:02:34.805 --> 00:02:37.070
The kernel uses
drivers to enable

68
00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.305
applications to execute tasks.

69
00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:42.110
The Linux kernel helps
ensure that the system

70
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:44.030
allocates resources
more efficiently

71
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:46.225
and makes the
system work faster.

72
00:02:47.225 --> 00:02:48.320
Finally, the last component of

73
00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.315
the architecture
is the hardware.

74
00:02:50.315 --> 00:02:53.600
Hardware refers to the physical
components of a computer.

75
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.985
You can compare this to
software applications

76
00:02:55.985 --> 00:02:58.240
which can be downloaded
into a system.

77
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.710
The hardware in your
computer are things

78
00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:04.060
like the CPU, mouse,
and keyboard.

79
00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:05.910
Congratulations!

80
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:07.730
We've now covered
the architecture

81
00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:09.440
of Linux. An understanding of

82
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.090
these components will help you

83
00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:14.250
become increasingly
familiar with Linux.
