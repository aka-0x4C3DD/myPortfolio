00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.330
Hello again! In this video,

2
00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:05.040
we're going to learn
a little more about

3
00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.380
the shell and how to
communicate with it.

4
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.240
Communicating with a computer is

5
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.400
like having a conversation
with your friend.

6
00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.590
One person asks a question

7
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.335
and the other person
answers with a response.

8
00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:18.255
If you don't know the answer,

9
00:00:18.255 --> 00:00:20.250
you can just say you
don't know the answer.

10
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:22.545
When you communicate
with the shell,

11
00:00:22.545 --> 00:00:25.290
the commands in the
shell can take input,

12
00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:28.155
give output, or give
error messages.

13
00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:30.075
Let's explore standard input,

14
00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:33.210
standard output, and error
messages in more detail.

15
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:35.640
Standard input consists
of information

16
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.310
received by the OS
via the command line.

17
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:40.140
This is like you
asking your friend

18
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.050
a question during
a conversation.

19
00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.445
The information is input from
your keyboard to the shell.

20
00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:48.120
If the shell can
interpret your request,

21
00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.000
it asks the kernel
for the resources it

22
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.055
needs to execute
the related task.

23
00:00:53.055 --> 00:00:53.795
Let's take a look at
this through echo,

24
00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:56.740
a Linux command that outputs
a specified string of text.

25
00:00:56.740 --> 00:00:58.820
String data is data consisting

26
00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.040
of an ordered sequence
of characters.

27
00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.170
In our example, we'll just have

28
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.840
it output the string of: hello.

29
00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:11.395
So, as input, we'll type: echo
hello into the shell.

30
00:01:11.395 --> 00:01:15.485
Later, when we press enter,
we'll get the output.

31
00:01:15.485 --> 00:01:17.075
But before we do that,

32
00:01:17.075 --> 00:01:20.915
let's first discuss the concept
of output in more detail.

33
00:01:21.915 --> 00:01:23.210
Standard output is
the information

34
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.595
returned by the OS
through the shell.

35
00:01:25.595 --> 00:01:27.500
In the same way that your friend

36
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.360
gives an answer
to your question,

37
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.460
output is a computer's response
to the command you input.

38
00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.910
Output is what you receive.

39
00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.050
Let's pick up where we left
off in our example and send

40
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:43.100
the input of: echo hello to
the OS by pressing enter.

41
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.375
Immediately, the shell
returns the output of: hello.

42
00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:48.650
Finally, standard error contains

43
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.040
error messages returned by
the OS through the shell.

44
00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.540
Just like your friend might

45
00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:56.045
indicate that they can't
answer a question,

46
00:01:56.045 --> 00:01:57.500
the system responds with

47
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.460
an error message if they can't
respond to your command.

48
00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.170
Sometimes this might
occur when we misspell

49
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.430
a command or the system

50
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.530
doesn't know the
response to the command.

51
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.380
Other times, it might happen
because we don't have

52
00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:12.425
the appropriate permissions
to perform a command.

53
00:02:13.425 --> 00:02:14.330
We'll explore another example

54
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:15.980
that demonstrates
standard error.

55
00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:19.600
Let's input: eco hello
into the shell.

56
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.035
Notice I intentionally
misspelled echo as e-c-o.

57
00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:25.415
When we press enter,

58
00:02:25.415 --> 00:02:27.595
an error message appears.

59
00:02:28.595 --> 00:02:29.900
To wrap up, we've covered

60
00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:32.510
the basics of communication
with the shell.

61
00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:35.960
Communication with the
shell can only go in one of

62
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:37.880
three ways: the system

63
00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.385
receives a commandâ€”this is input;

64
00:02:40.385 --> 00:02:43.960
the system responds to the
command and produces output;

65
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.585
and finally, the system
doesn't know how to respond,

66
00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:49.025
resulting in an error.

67
00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:52.160
Later, you'll become much
more familiar with this as

68
00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:56.220
we explore commands useful
for security professionals.
