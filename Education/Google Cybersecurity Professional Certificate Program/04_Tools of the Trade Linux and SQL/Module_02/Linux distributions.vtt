00:00:01.024 --> 00:00:03.456
Let's learn a little bit
more about Linux and

2
00:00:03.456 --> 00:00:08.075
what you need to know about this operating
system when working as a security analyst.

3
00:00:08.075 --> 00:00:11.497
Linux is a very customizable
operating system.

4
00:00:11.497 --> 00:00:15.215
Unlike other operating systems,
there are different versions available for

5
00:00:15.215 --> 00:00:15.784
you to use.

6
00:00:15.784 --> 00:00:19.477
These different versions of
Linux are called distributions.

7
00:00:19.477 --> 00:00:23.180
You might also hear them called
distros or flavors of Linux.

8
00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.914
It's essential for you to understand
the distribution that you're using

9
00:00:26.914 --> 00:00:29.958
so you know what tools and
apps are available to you.

10
00:00:29.958 --> 00:00:30.823
For example,

11
00:00:30.823 --> 00:00:35.369
Debian is a distro that has different
tools than the Ubuntu distribution.

12
00:00:36.369 --> 00:00:38.700
Let's use an analogy to
describe Linux distributions.

13
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:41.287
Think of the OS as a vehicle.

14
00:00:41.287 --> 00:00:46.327
First, we'll start with its engine—that
would be the kernel. Just as the engine

15
00:00:46.327 --> 00:00:51.384
makes a vehicle run, the kernel is the
most important component of the Linux OS.

16
00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:55.433
Because the Linux kernel is open source,
anyone can take the kernel and

17
00:00:55.433 --> 00:00:57.675
modify it to build a new distribution.

18
00:00:57.675 --> 00:01:01.387
This is comparable to a vehicle
manufacturer taking an engine and

19
00:01:01.387 --> 00:01:04.222
creating different types of vehicles:
trucks,

20
00:01:04.222 --> 00:01:07.879
cars, vans, convertibles,
busses, airplanes, and so on.

21
00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:12.508
These different types of vehicles can be
compared to different Linux distributions.

22
00:01:12.508 --> 00:01:15.595
A bus is used to transport lots of people.

23
00:01:15.595 --> 00:01:20.539
A truck is used to transport a large
number of goods across vast distances.

24
00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:23.938
An aircraft transports
passengers or goods by air.

25
00:01:24.938 --> 00:01:26.894
Just as each vehicle
serves its own purpose,

26
00:01:26.894 --> 00:01:30.515
different distributions are used for
different reasons.

27
00:01:30.515 --> 00:01:35.140
Additionally, vehicles all have different
components which distinguish them from

28
00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.854
each other.

29
00:01:35.854 --> 00:01:39.490
Aircrafts have control panels
with buttons and knobs.

30
00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.063
Regular cars have four tires,
but trucks can have more.

31
00:01:43.063 --> 00:01:48.596
Similarly, different Linux distributions
contain different preinstalled programs,

32
00:01:48.596 --> 00:01:50.622
user interfaces, and much more.

33
00:01:50.622 --> 00:01:53.887
A lot of this is based on
what the Linux user needs, but

34
00:01:53.887 --> 00:01:57.572
some distros are also
chosen based on preference—the

35
00:01:57.572 --> 00:02:01.292
same way a sports car
might be chosen as a vehicle.

36
00:02:02.292 --> 00:02:05.450
The advantage of using Linux as
an OS is that you can customize it.

37
00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.006
Distributions include the Linux kernel,
utilities,

38
00:02:09.006 --> 00:02:12.044
a package management system, and
an installer.

39
00:02:12.044 --> 00:02:14.764
We learned earlier that
Linux is open source, and

40
00:02:14.764 --> 00:02:17.765
anyone can contribute to
adding to the source code.

41
00:02:17.765 --> 00:02:20.072
That is how new distributions are created.

42
00:02:21.072 --> 00:02:22.775
All distros are derived
from another distro, but

43
00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:25.855
there are a few that are considered
parent distributions.

44
00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:30.372
Red Hat® is the parent of CentOS, and
Slackware® is the parent of SUSE®.

45
00:02:30.372 --> 00:02:34.153
Both Ubuntu and
KALI LINUX™ are derived from Debian.

46
00:02:35.153 --> 00:02:39.032
As we continue, we're going to take a look
at some of the distributions most commonly

47
00:02:39.032 --> 00:02:40.680
used by security analysts.

48
00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:43.080
The more you understand
these distributions,

49
00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.460
the easier your work will be.
