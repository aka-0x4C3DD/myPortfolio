00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.398
You might have seen or
heard the name Linux in the past.

2
00:00:04.398 --> 00:00:08.924
But did you know Linux is the most-used
operating system in security today?

3
00:00:08.924 --> 00:00:12.505
Let's start by taking a look at Linux and
how it's used in security.

4
00:00:13.505 --> 00:00:15.737
Linux is an open-source operating system.

5
00:00:15.737 --> 00:00:17.588
It was created in two parts.

6
00:00:17.588 --> 00:00:22.235
In the early 1990s, two different people
were working separately on projects to

7
00:00:22.235 --> 00:00:24.051
improve computer engineering.

8
00:00:24.051 --> 00:00:27.355
The first person was Linus Torvalds.

9
00:00:27.355 --> 00:00:31.303
At the time, the UNIX operating
system was already in use.

10
00:00:31.303 --> 00:00:35.699
He wanted to improve it and make it
open source and accessible to anyone.

11
00:00:35.699 --> 00:00:40.045
What was revolutionary was his
introduction of the Linux kernel.

12
00:00:40.045 --> 00:00:43.426
We're going to learn what
the kernel does later.

13
00:00:44.426 --> 00:00:47.052
Around the same time,
Richard Stallman started working on GNU.

14
00:00:47.052 --> 00:00:49.896
GNU was also an operating
system based on UNIX.

15
00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:54.426
Stallman shared Torvalds' goal of
creating software that was free and

16
00:00:54.426 --> 00:00:55.473
open to anyone.

17
00:00:55.473 --> 00:00:59.642
After working on GNU for
a few years, the missing element for

18
00:00:59.642 --> 00:01:01.697
the software was a kernel.

19
00:01:01.697 --> 00:01:06.590
Together, Torvalds' and Stallmanâ€™s innovations
made what is commonly referred

20
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:07.425
to as Linux.

21
00:01:08.425 --> 00:01:10.188
Now that you've learned
the history behind Linux,

22
00:01:10.188 --> 00:01:12.768
let's take a look at
what makes Linux unique.

23
00:01:12.768 --> 00:01:15.752
As mentioned before, Linux is open source,

24
00:01:15.752 --> 00:01:20.787
meaning anyone can have access to
the operating system and the source code.

25
00:01:20.787 --> 00:01:25.716
Linux and many of the programs that come
with Linux are licensed under the terms

26
00:01:25.716 --> 00:01:30.733
of the GNU Public License, which allow you
to use, share, and modify them freely.

27
00:01:30.733 --> 00:01:35.230
Thanks to Linux's open-source philosophy
as well as a strong feature set,

28
00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.769
an entire community of developers
has adopted this operating system.

29
00:01:39.769 --> 00:01:43.425
These developers are able to
collaborate on projects and

30
00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:45.489
advance computing together.

31
00:01:45.489 --> 00:01:47.020
As a security analyst,

32
00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:51.315
you'll discover that Linux is
used at different organizations.

33
00:01:51.315 --> 00:01:56.070
More specifically,
Linux is used in many security programs.

34
00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:59.334
Another unique feature about Linux
is the different distributions, or

35
00:01:59.334 --> 00:02:01.175
varieties, that have been developed.

36
00:02:01.175 --> 00:02:03.783
Because of the large
community contribution,

37
00:02:03.783 --> 00:02:06.401
there are over 600 distributions of Linux.

38
00:02:06.401 --> 00:02:09.616
Later you'll learn more
about distributions.

39
00:02:10.616 --> 00:02:14.197
Finally, let's take a look at how you
would use Linux in an entry-level

40
00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:15.560
security position.

41
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.010
As a security analyst, you'll use many
tools and programs in everyday work.

42
00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.754
You might examine different types of logs
to identify what's going on in the system.

43
00:02:24.754 --> 00:02:25.705
For example,

44
00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:30.868
you might find yourself looking at
an error log when investigating an issue.

45
00:02:30.868 --> 00:02:34.617
Another place where you will use
Linux is to verify access and

46
00:02:34.617 --> 00:02:38.451
authorization in an identity and
access management system.

47
00:02:38.451 --> 00:02:44.280
In security, managing access is key
in order to ensure a secure system.

48
00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.487
We'll take a closer look into access and
authorization later.

49
00:02:49.487 --> 00:02:51.770
Finally, as an analyst,
you might find yourself working

50
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.325
with specific distributions designed for
a particular task.

51
00:02:55.325 --> 00:03:00.113
For example, you might use a distribution
that has a digital forensic tool

52
00:03:00.113 --> 00:03:03.232
to investigate what
happened in an event alert.

53
00:03:03.232 --> 00:03:05.628
You might also use
a distribution that's for

54
00:03:05.628 --> 00:03:09.801
pen testing in offensive security to
look for vulnerabilities in the system.

55
00:03:09.801 --> 00:03:12.645
Distributions are created to
fit the needs of their users.

56
00:03:12.645 --> 00:03:15.545
I hope you're excited to
learn more about Linux.

57
00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:18.730
This will be a very useful
skill in the security field.
