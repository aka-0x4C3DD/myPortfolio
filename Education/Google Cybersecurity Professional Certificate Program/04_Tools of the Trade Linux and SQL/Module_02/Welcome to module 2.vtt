00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.755
Welcome back! We have another
important topic to explore.

2
00:00:04.755 --> 00:00:06.975
Previously, you learned about

3
00:00:06.975 --> 00:00:09.510
operating systems
and user interfaces.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:11.850
You learned how operating
systems work and

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.455
how resources are
allocated in computers.

6
00:00:14.455 --> 00:00:17.855
We also reviewed several
common operating systems.

7
00:00:17.855 --> 00:00:20.510
You may already have a
favorite operating system.

8
00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:22.820
It's common to hear that
people are fans of one

9
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.610
over another, but in
the security world,

10
00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.530
Linux is commonly used.

11
00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:30.260
In this section, you'll
be learning more about

12
00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.030
the Linux operating
system and how

13
00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.280
it's used in everyday
tasks in security.

14
00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:37.580
First, you'll learn about
the architecture of Linux.

15
00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.110
After this, we'll compare

16
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.690
the different distributions
of Linux that are available.

17
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.000
Lastly, you'll
explore the shell,

18
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:45.860
a key Linux component that

19
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.295
allows you to communicate
with the system.

20
00:00:48.295 --> 00:00:50.270
I remember when I
first learned about

21
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:51.800
the Linux OS, and I'm

22
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:54.630
really happy to
explore it with you now.
