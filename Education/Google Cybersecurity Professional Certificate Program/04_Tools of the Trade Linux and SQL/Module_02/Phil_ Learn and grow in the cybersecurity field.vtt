Hi, I'm Phil I'm the Chief

2
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.440
Information Security
Officer for Google Cloud,

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:11.670
and a big part of that is,
of course, cybersecurity.

4
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.860
So, in cyber you've
always got to learn,

5
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.600
you've always got to
stay up to date for

6
00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.570
the simple reason
that technology and

7
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:20.370
business and the world of

8
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:23.610
our, kind of digital lives is
just always changing.

9
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.840
The online services that you use

10
00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:28.745
today are probably
very different

11
00:00:28.745 --> 00:00:31.165
even just when what they
were 12 months ago.

12
00:00:31.165 --> 00:00:32.810
In the mid '90s, I
worked on one of

13
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:35.780
the world's first
internet banking systems.

14
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.970
And essentially we were building and

15
00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:40.145
coding all of the
security ourselves.

16
00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:43.460
I remember working on
the first web browsers,

17
00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:44.929
the first web servers,

18
00:00:44.929 --> 00:00:48.450
the first implementations of
encryption on the Internet.

19
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.050
This was even before
Google even existed.

20
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:52.670
And so this was the very beginning of

21
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:54.560
the Internet and we were
literally kind of assembling

22
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.420
and building this and
learning how to do

23
00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.675
it as we went along.

24
00:00:58.675 --> 00:01:00.860
When you are first getting
into cybersecurity,

25
00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.915
it's important to
not get overwhelmed.

26
00:01:02.915 --> 00:01:04.820
It's a very big space.

27
00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:07.670
And all of us started off
at where you are today.

28
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.455
And we had to learn into that.

29
00:01:09.455 --> 00:01:11.765
At one point, I
didn't know Linux,

30
00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:13.090
I didn't know how to program.

31
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.910
I didn't know various parts
of other operating systems.

32
00:01:15.910 --> 00:01:18.625
And I had to learn step-by-step,

33
00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:20.330
how all of that worked and

34
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.000
gradually build up that
knowledge over time.

35
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.260
And even now I still have to

36
00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:25.865
look things up
occasionally because

37
00:01:25.865 --> 00:01:27.380
I don't keep
everything in my head

38
00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.090
all at once and
that's totally fine.

39
00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.340
When you're approaching
a new situation,

40
00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.560
you're always going to
have a degree of anxiety

41
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.820
about whether you're going to be

42
00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.290
able to learn it quickly enough.

43
00:01:36.290 --> 00:01:38.389
And generally, with
enough experience,

44
00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:40.230
you're gradually comfortable
that you will.

45
00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:42.890
But again, this is important
to remember that you don't

46
00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.770
have to learn everything
about everything all at once.

47
00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:48.215
Most of the time
you learn enough to

48
00:01:48.215 --> 00:01:50.960
be enough of value in the
initial part of the process,

49
00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.400
then you learn as you go.

50
00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:54.440
Start off by writing
a few lines of

51
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:55.910
simple code or looking at

52
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.620
somebody else's
code and trying to

53
00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.260
understand what it does
and then change it a

54
00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:03.155
little bit and just
incrementally work into this.

55
00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:05.030
Build that foundation
of knowledge

56
00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.070
that gives you the ability
to learn other things,

57
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.320
and I think things
will stem from that.
