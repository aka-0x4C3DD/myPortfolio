00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:04.798
In this section, we're going to cover
a Linux distribution that's widely used in

2
00:00:04.798 --> 00:00:07.020
security and discuss KALI LINUX™.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.567
KALI LINUX™ is a trademark of Offensive
Security and is Debian derived.

4
00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:16.420
This open-source distro was made
specifically with penetration testing and

5
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.990
digital forensics in mind.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.612
There are many tools
pre-installed into KALI LINUX™.

7
00:00:21.612 --> 00:00:25.920
It's important to note that KALI LINUX™
should be used on a virtual machine.

8
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.085
This prevents damage to your system in
the event its tools are used improperly.

9
00:00:30.085 --> 00:00:34.570
An additional benefit is that using
a virtual machine gives you the ability to

10
00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:36.000
revert to a previous state.

11
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.850
As security professionals advance in their careers,
some specialize in penetration testing.

12
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.875
A penetration test is a simulated attack
that helps identify vulnerabilities in

13
00:00:46.875 --> 00:00:51.740
systems, networks, websites,
applications, and processes.

14
00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.330
KALI LINUX™ has numerous tools that
are useful during penetration testing.

15
00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:57.854
Let's look at a few examples.

16
00:00:58.854 --> 00:01:03.280
To begin, Metasploit can be used to look for and
exploit vulnerabilities on machines.

17
00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.073
Burp Suite is another tool that helps to
test for weaknesses in web applications.

18
00:01:08.073 --> 00:01:12.690
And finally, John the Ripper is
a tool used to guess passwords.

19
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.500
As a security analyst, your work
might involve digital forensics.

20
00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.615
Digital forensics is
the process of collecting and

21
00:01:19.615 --> 00:01:23.700
analyzing data to determine what
has happened after an attack.

22
00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:24.504
For example,

23
00:01:24.504 --> 00:01:29.450
you might take an investigative look
at data related to network activity.

24
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.717
KALI LINUX™ is also
a useful distribution for

25
00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:35.290
security professionals who
are involved in digital forensic work.

26
00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:39.647
It has a large number of tools that
can be used for this. As one example,

27
00:01:39.647 --> 00:01:44.630
tcpdump is a command-line packet analyzer.
It's used to capture network traffic.

28
00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.180
Another tool commonly used in
the security profession is Wireshark.

29
00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.923
It has a graphical user interface
that can be used to analyze live and

30
00:01:52.923 --> 00:01:54.700
captured network traffic.

31
00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:56.230
And as a final example,

32
00:01:56.230 --> 00:02:00.890
Autopsy is a forensic tool used to
analyze hard drives and smartphones.

33
00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.240
These are just a few tools
included with KALI LINUX™.

34
00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.590
This distribution has many tools used to
conduct pen testing and digital forensics.

35
00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:13.737
We've explored how KALI LINUX™ is
an important distribution that's widely

36
00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:14.773
used in security,

37
00:02:14.773 --> 00:02:18.998
but there are other distributions that
security professionals use as well.

38
00:02:18.998 --> 00:02:21.658
Next we'll explore a few
more distributions.
