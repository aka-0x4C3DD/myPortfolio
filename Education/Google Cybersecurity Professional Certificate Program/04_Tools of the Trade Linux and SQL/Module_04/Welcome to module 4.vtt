00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.185
In the world of security,
diversity is important.

2
00:00:04.185 --> 00:00:06.420
Diverse perspectives are often

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.460
needed to find
effective solutions.

4
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.830
This is also true of
the tools we use.

5
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:12.750
Your job will often require

6
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.910
you to use a lot
of diverse tools.

7
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.455
In the last section,

8
00:00:16.455 --> 00:00:18.870
we studied the Linux command
line and learned how

9
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:21.570
this tool can help you search
and filter through data,

10
00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.700
navigate through the
Linux file system,

11
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.365
and authenticate users.

12
00:00:25.365 --> 00:00:27.855
Now, we'll learn
about another tool.

13
00:00:28.855 --> 00:00:31.290
In this section, we'll
explore SQL and how it allows

14
00:00:31.290 --> 00:00:33.390
you to analyze data in a way

15
00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.030
needed for your role
as a security analyst.

16
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.220
We're going to start
off by learning about

17
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:41.245
relational databases and
how they're structured.

18
00:00:41.245 --> 00:00:43.490
From there, we're
going to introduce

19
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.320
SQL queries and how to use

20
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:47.585
them to access data
from databases.

21
00:00:47.585 --> 00:00:50.000
We then move on to SQL filters,

22
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.830
which help us refine our queries

23
00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.230
to get the exact
information we need.

24
00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:57.020
Lastly, we'll explore SQL joins,

25
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.735
which allow you to
combine tables together.

26
00:01:00.735 --> 00:01:02.795
When I'm presented with a
problem or a project at work,

27
00:01:02.795 --> 00:01:05.530
I often have to sift through
a large amount of data.

28
00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:06.700
When I use SQL,

29
00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:09.200
I'm able to review data quickly
and provide results with

30
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.790
confidence since the queries are

31
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:13.010
consistent and easily executed.

32
00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:15.950
SQL is a very powerful
and flexible tool.

33
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.660
Throughout this section, you'll

34
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:19.220
learn how to use
the parts of it you

35
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.640
need as a security analyst
and gain hands-on experience.

36
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:26.580
Good luck, and I'll join you
for the rest of the course!
