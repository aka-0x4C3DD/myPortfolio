00:00:01.066 --> 00:00:05.545
As a security analyst, you'll need to
be familiar both with databases and

2
00:00:05.545 --> 00:00:07.405
the tools used to access them.

3
00:00:07.405 --> 00:00:09.776
Now that we know the basics of databases,

4
00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:13.569
let's focus on an important tool
used to work with them, SQL, and

5
00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:17.186
learn more about how analysts
like yourself might utilize it.

6
00:00:17.186 --> 00:00:22.185
SQL, or as it's also pronounced, S-Q-L,
stands for Structured Query Language.

7
00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:26.054
SQL is a programming language used
to create, interact with, and

8
00:00:26.054 --> 00:00:28.346
request information from a database.

9
00:00:29.346 --> 00:00:32.730
Before learning more about SQL,
we need to define what query means.

10
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.860
A query is a request for data from a
database table or a combination of tables.

11
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.297
Nearly all relational databases rely
on some version of SQL to query data.

12
00:00:43.297 --> 00:00:47.513
The different versions of SQL only have
slight differences in their structure,

13
00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:49.499
like where to place quotation marks.

14
00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:51.403
Whatever variety of SQL you use,

15
00:00:51.403 --> 00:00:55.826
you'll find it to be a very important
tool in your work as a security analyst.

16
00:00:56.826 --> 00:00:59.273
First, let's discuss how SQL
can help you retrieve logs.

17
00:00:59.273 --> 00:01:03.817
A log is a record of events that occur
within an organization's systems.

18
00:01:03.945 --> 00:01:09.052
As a security analyst, you might be tasked
with reviewing logs for various reasons.

19
00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:14.762
For example, some logs might contain
details on machines used in a company,

20
00:01:14.762 --> 00:01:15.765
and as an analyst,

21
00:01:16.765 --> 00:01:18.733
you would need to find those machines
that weren't configured properly.

22
00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:23.271
Other logs might describe the visitors
to your website or web app and

23
00:01:23.271 --> 00:01:25.951
the tasks they perform.

24
00:01:25.951 --> 00:01:26.791
In that case,

25
00:01:27.791 --> 00:01:30.560
you might be looking for unusual patterns
that may point to malicious activity.

26
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.973
Security logs are often very large and
hard to process.

27
00:01:34.973 --> 00:01:36.878
There are millions of data points, and

28
00:01:36.878 --> 00:01:39.253
it's very time consuming
to find what you need.

29
00:01:39.253 --> 00:01:43.543
But this is where SQL comes in! It can
search through millions of data points to

30
00:01:43.543 --> 00:01:47.316
extract relevant rows of data using
one query that takes seconds to run.

31
00:01:47.316 --> 00:01:48.390
That's pretty useful, right?

32
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:53.020
SQL is also a very common language
used for basic data analytics,

33
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.784
another set of skills that will set
you apart as a security analyst.

34
00:01:55.784 --> 00:02:01.047
As a security analyst, you can use
SQL's filtering to find data to support

35
00:02:01.047 --> 00:02:04.984
security-related decisions and
analyze when things may go wrong.

36
00:02:04.984 --> 00:02:05.872
For instance,

37
00:02:05.872 --> 00:02:09.843
you can identify what machines
haven't received the latest patch.

38
00:02:09.843 --> 00:02:14.308
This is important because patches are
updates that help secure against attacks.

39
00:02:14.308 --> 00:02:18.143
As another example,
you can use SQL to determine the best time

40
00:02:18.143 --> 00:02:21.030
to update a machine based
on when it's least used.

41
00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:23.850
Now that we know why
SQL is important to us,

42
00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.701
we're going to start making basic
queries to a sample database!

43
00:02:27.701 --> 00:02:31.148
This is definitely exciting, and
I'll meet you in the next video.
