00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.880
Congratulations! We've made it

2
00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:05.370
together through the end
of our focus on SQL.

3
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:06.810
You've put in a lot of

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:08.820
work and learned an
important tool that

5
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.285
will help you on your journey
as a security analyst.

6
00:00:12.285 --> 00:00:14.430
Let's take a moment
to go through all

7
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:16.470
of the topics you
learned in this section.

8
00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:17.970
We started by learning about

9
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:19.695
the structure of
relational databases

10
00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:21.090
and how we can access them by

11
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.115
using the query language SQL.

12
00:00:23.115 --> 00:00:25.215
We then got hands-on practice

13
00:00:25.215 --> 00:00:27.480
with writing our
own SQL queries.

14
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.210
We used SQL to bring up
information you might

15
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.240
need on the job when
working as an analyst.

16
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:35.505
We then focused on SQL filters.

17
00:00:35.505 --> 00:00:38.100
We started with simple
conditions with strings,

18
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.870
and by the end, we
learned how to use

19
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.190
multiple filters in one query.

20
00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:44.090
We concluded the unit with SQL

21
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.550
joins and learned how to
join multiple tables,

22
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.640
giving us even more
information at once.

23
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.410
By completing this course,

24
00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.880
you just took a very big step in

25
00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.475
your future career as
a security analyst.

26
00:00:55.475 --> 00:00:57.050
You have been introduced to

27
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.975
a powerful tool that can
help you in your work.

28
00:00:59.975 --> 00:01:01.400
Whenever you need to,

29
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.775
I encourage you to revisit
the materials in this course.

30
00:01:04.775 --> 00:01:08.375
Learning a querying language
like SQL takes time.

31
00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.210
Thank you again for joining
me in this journey.

32
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.640
I hope you'll enjoy using
SQL as much as I do.
