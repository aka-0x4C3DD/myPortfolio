00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.570
In this video, we're going to be

2
00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:06.195
running our very
first SQL query!

3
00:00:06.195 --> 00:00:08.640
This query will be based on

4
00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:10.560
a common work task
that you might

5
00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.955
encounter as a security analyst.

6
00:00:12.955 --> 00:00:14.670
We're going to determine

7
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.640
which computer has been
assigned to a certain employee.

8
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.750
Let's say we have access
to the employees table.

9
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.855
The employees table
has five columns.

10
00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.620
Two of them, employee_id
and device_id,

11
00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.440
contain the
information that we need.

12
00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.410
We'll write a query
to this table that

13
00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:36.470
returns only those two
columns from the table.

14
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.990
The two SQL keywords we need for

15
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.915
basic SQL queries
are SELECT and FROM.

16
00:00:41.915 --> 00:00:45.410
SELECT indicates which
columns to return.

17
00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.955
FROM indicates which
table to query.

18
00:00:48.955 --> 00:00:52.250
The use of these keywords
in SQL is very similar

19
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.595
to how we would use these
words in everyday language.

20
00:00:55.595 --> 00:00:59.360
For example, we can
ask a friend to select

21
00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.830
apples and bananas from

22
00:01:00.830 --> 00:01:03.800
the big box when going
out to buy fruit.

23
00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:07.210
This is already very
similar to SQL.

24
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.540
So let's go ahead and use
SELECT and FROM in SQL to

25
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.310
return the information
we need on

26
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.965
employees and the
computers they use.

27
00:01:15.965 --> 00:01:19.550
We start off by typing
in the SQL statement.

28
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.490
After FROM, we've identified

29
00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:23.810
that the information will be

30
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.030
pulled from the employees table.

31
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:30.035
And after SELECT, employee_id
and device_id

32
00:01:30.035 --> 00:01:31.850
indicate the two columns we

33
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.300
want to return from this table.

34
00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.770
Notice how a comma separates

35
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.425
the two columns that
we want to return.

36
00:01:40.425 --> 00:01:41.720
It's also worth
mentioning a couple of

37
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.065
key aspects related to
the syntax of SQL here.

38
00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:48.440
Syntax refers to the
rules that determine

39
00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:52.115
what is correctly structured
in a computing language.

40
00:01:52.115 --> 00:01:55.940
In SQL, keywords are
not case-sensitive, so

41
00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.155
you could also write select
and from in lowercase,

42
00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:02.720
but we're placing them in
capital letters because

43
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.285
it makes the query
easier to understand.

44
00:02:05.285 --> 00:02:07.655
Another aspect of this syntax

45
00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:09.020
is that semicolons are

46
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:10.865
placed at the end
of the statement.

47
00:02:11.865 --> 00:02:14.585
And now, we'll run the query
by pressing Enter.

48
00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:17.540
The output gives us
the information we

49
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.419
need to match employees
to their computers.

50
00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:23.905
We just ran our very
first SQL query!

51
00:02:24.905 --> 00:02:25.910
Suppose you wanted to know

52
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.960
what department
the employee using

53
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.820
the computer is from, or their

54
00:02:29.820 --> 00:02:32.345
username, or the
office they work in.

55
00:02:32.345 --> 00:02:34.820
To do that, we can
use SQL to make

56
00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.305
another statement
that prints out

57
00:02:36.305 --> 00:02:38.270
all of the columns
from the table.

58
00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:41.675
We can do this by placing
an asterisk after SELECT.

59
00:02:41.675 --> 00:02:44.745
This is commonly referred
to as select all.

60
00:02:44.745 --> 00:02:49.625
Now, let's run this query to
the employees table in SQL.

61
00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:53.020
And now we have the full
table in the output.

62
00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:55.265
You just made it
through a basic query

63
00:02:55.265 --> 00:02:57.455
in SQL, congratulations!

64
00:02:57.455 --> 00:02:59.000
In the next video,

65
00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.740
we'll learn how
to add filters to

66
00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.930
our queries, so I'll
meet you there!
