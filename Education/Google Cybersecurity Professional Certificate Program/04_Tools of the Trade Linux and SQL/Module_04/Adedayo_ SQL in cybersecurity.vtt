00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.165
My name is Adedayo,

2
00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:08.145
and I'm a Security
Engineer at Google.

3
00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:10.335
A lot of people think you
need to have a degree in

4
00:00:10.335 --> 00:00:12.480
computer science, right
to be able to get

5
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.730
into cybersecurity. I
don't think that's true.

6
00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.110
Take me for an example,

7
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:19.485
I started learning
IT from Lagos,

8
00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:21.345
Nigeria where I was
born and raised,

9
00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:23.220
and then I'm all
the way here now

10
00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:25.120
in Silicon Valley,
working for Google.

11
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.170
I think that's just amazing
and a dream come true.

12
00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:32.445
You taking this certificate
is a first step to you

13
00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:34.755
making a commitment to switching

14
00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.665
your career to cybersecurity.
Kudos to you on that.

15
00:00:37.665 --> 00:00:39.570
SQL is one of

16
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.890
the skillset you need to
have in your toolbox as a

17
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.890
cybersecurity professional
because you can

18
00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.070
very quickly make decisions,

19
00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.770
not just off the bat,

20
00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.780
but make decisions
with data backing you,

21
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.270
and be able to communicate
with your team,

22
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.310
with stakeholders
about why you made

23
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.160
a decision because it's one
thing to be able to say,

24
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.780
we need to do this, it's

25
00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.480
another thing to say
we need to do this

26
00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.015
and here's the data that I
wrote my SQL statements about.

27
00:01:08.015 --> 00:01:11.370
I learned SQL by, first,

28
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.940
as a coursework in school,
that was really great,

29
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.135
but I think I forgot everything
about that after school.

30
00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:21.545
The next step that I took
was taking online courses,

31
00:01:21.545 --> 00:01:23.930
such as the one you're
taking right now to learn

32
00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:25.610
SQL and the fundamentals

33
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.725
about it and how
to really use it.

34
00:01:27.725 --> 00:01:32.245
Then the first time I used SQL
practically was at Google.

35
00:01:32.245 --> 00:01:34.415
You really need to practice.

36
00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:37.865
I think with anything else,
practice makes perfect.

37
00:01:37.865 --> 00:01:41.285
Being able to, even if it's
just a few hours a week,

38
00:01:41.285 --> 00:01:45.360
put aside time to practice
writing SQL statement.

39
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.600
Having that skill is
something that will

40
00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:49.790
be very applicable
to your first job,

41
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.880
and you can use that to
make data-driven decisions.

42
00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.445
I feel very fulfilled
working in cybersecurity.

43
00:01:55.445 --> 00:01:57.395
I feel very energized,

44
00:01:57.395 --> 00:01:58.685
come into work every day.

45
00:01:58.685 --> 00:02:01.325
Not only because
I get to work on

46
00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:02.630
really complex problems and

47
00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:04.090
try to figure out
solutions for them,

48
00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:06.620
but I also have great
teammates that we

49
00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.335
all come together and
tackle the problem.

50
00:02:09.335 --> 00:02:11.855
Being able to go
to bed at night,

51
00:02:11.855 --> 00:02:15.365
knowing that the work that
I do is for the better of

52
00:02:15.365 --> 00:02:18.065
Google users and
Google employees

53
00:02:18.065 --> 00:02:21.360
is a very rewarding
feeling for me.
