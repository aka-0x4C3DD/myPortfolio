00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.030
Hi! Welcome to this course

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.820
on computing basics
for security.

3
00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.500
My name is Kim, and I work as

4
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.705
a Technical Program
Manager in security.

5
00:00:08.705 --> 00:00:10.945
I grew up with computers
and the internet

6
00:00:10.945 --> 00:00:12.900
but didn't really
consider security as

7
00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.670
a career opportunity until I saw

8
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.130
how it was interwoven
into technology.

9
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.140
Before my first security job,

10
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.285
I worked on a cloud
application team

11
00:00:21.285 --> 00:00:24.135
and had to regularly interact
with the security team.

12
00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:27.090
It was my first experience
working with security,

13
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.550
but the idea of protecting
information and working

14
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.775
with others towards that
goal was exciting to me.

15
00:00:32.775 --> 00:00:36.405
As a result, I decided to
work towards my CISSP,

16
00:00:36.405 --> 00:00:37.695
which led me to some new job

17
00:00:37.695 --> 00:00:39.495
opportunities at my company,

18
00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:42.615
and I was then able to
move into security.

19
00:00:43.615 --> 00:00:45.215
At this point, if you've
been following along,

20
00:00:45.215 --> 00:00:46.820
you've already
explored a variety of

21
00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.100
concepts useful to
the security field,

22
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.995
including security
domains and networking.

23
00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:53.495
I'm excited to join you

24
00:00:53.495 --> 00:00:55.295
during the next part
of the program.

25
00:00:55.295 --> 00:00:56.780
We'll take it slow
so that you can

26
00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.150
understand these topics
in practical ways.

27
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.640
The focus of this course
is computing basics.

28
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:03.020
When you understand how

29
00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.510
the machines in an
organization's system work,

30
00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:07.040
it helps you do your job as

31
00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:09.280
a security analyst
more efficiently.

32
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.630
Part of your job as a
security analyst is to

33
00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.255
keep systems protected
from possible attacks.

34
00:01:14.255 --> 00:01:15.935
You're one of the
first levels of

35
00:01:15.935 --> 00:01:18.575
defense in protecting an
organization's data.

36
00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:20.105
To do this effectively,

37
00:01:20.105 --> 00:01:21.680
it's helpful to understand how

38
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:24.265
the system you're
protecting works.

39
00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:26.570
In addition, you may need to

40
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.890
investigate events to help
correct errors in the system.

41
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.315
Being familiar with
Linux operating system

42
00:01:32.315 --> 00:01:33.920
and its associated commands,

43
00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.750
and also being able
to interact with

44
00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:37.130
an organization's data through

45
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:39.350
SQL, will help you with that.

46
00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:41.015
In this course,
you'll learn about

47
00:01:41.015 --> 00:01:42.410
operating systems and how they

48
00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.405
relate to applications
and hardware.

49
00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:46.220
Next, you'll explore

50
00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.815
the Linux operating
system in more detail.

51
00:01:48.815 --> 00:01:50.885
Then you'll use the
Linux command line

52
00:01:50.885 --> 00:01:52.765
within a security context.

53
00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:55.760
Finally, we'll discuss how
you can use SQL to query

54
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.030
databases while working
as a security analyst.

55
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.920
I'm excited to explore all of

56
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.500
these topics with you.
Let's get started.
