00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.455
You made it to the
end of this course!

2
00:00:02.455 --> 00:00:05.065
Congratulationsâ€”you did it!

3
00:00:05.065 --> 00:00:07.600
I hope you are proud
of all you learned.

4
00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.855
The focus of this course
was computing basics.

5
00:00:10.855 --> 00:00:12.370
Understanding the basics of

6
00:00:12.370 --> 00:00:14.290
computing is a valuable skill as

7
00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.830
you transition into your
career as a security analyst.

8
00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.455
Let's recap what you
learned in this course.

9
00:00:20.455 --> 00:00:23.050
We first focused on
operating systems

10
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:25.600
and how they relate to
applications and hardware.

11
00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.150
Understanding how the
system you're protecting

12
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.075
works is essential for
doing your job effectively.

13
00:00:31.075 --> 00:00:34.045
That brings us to the
Linux operating system.

14
00:00:34.045 --> 00:00:36.415
When working in the
security profession,

15
00:00:36.415 --> 00:00:38.935
familiarity with
Linux is important.

16
00:00:38.935 --> 00:00:40.900
We first discussed
this architecture

17
00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:42.840
and various distributions.

18
00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:46.130
Then, we used a Linux
command line to carry

19
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.400
out tasks you might encounter
as a security analyst.

20
00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:51.080
Finally, we looked at

21
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:55.015
another useful tool and used
SQL to query databases.

22
00:00:56.015 --> 00:00:56.960
After this course, I

23
00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.340
hope you have a better
understanding of

24
00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:00.410
how these foundations
of computing support

25
00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:02.900
a security analyst
in their daily work.

26
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.945
I also hope you continue
your path with this program.

27
00:01:05.945 --> 00:01:07.670
There are a lot of other useful

28
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.355
and exciting topics ahead.

29
00:01:09.355 --> 00:01:11.720
Once again, congratulations.

30
00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:13.865
You've finished another course.

31
00:01:13.865 --> 00:01:16.630
Building skills is something
you should be proud of.

32
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:19.980
Keep it up as you progress
through this program.
