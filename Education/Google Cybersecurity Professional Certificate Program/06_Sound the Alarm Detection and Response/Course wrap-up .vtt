00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.255
Congratulations on
completing this course

2
00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:04.904
on detection and response!

3
00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.570
As you've progressed,
we've covered

4
00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:08.565
a wide range of
topics and tools.

5
00:00:09.565 --> 00:00:11.205
Let's take a moment to
review what you've learned.

6
00:00:11.205 --> 00:00:13.320
First, we began with an overview

7
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.375
of the incident
response lifecycle.

8
00:00:15.375 --> 00:00:17.670
You learned how security
teams coordinate

9
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:18.930
their response efforts.

10
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:20.610
And you explored the documentation,

11
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.305
detection, and management tools

12
00:00:22.305 --> 00:00:24.210
used in incident response.

13
00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.070
Next, you learned how to monitor

14
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.750
and analyze network traffic.

15
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.310
You learned about capturing and

16
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.580
analyzing packets using
packets sniffers.

17
00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.360
You also practiced using
tools like tcpdump

18
00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.515
to capture and
analyze network data

19
00:00:36.515 --> 00:00:39.145
to identify indicators
of compromise.

20
00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:42.260
Then, we explored
processes and procedures

21
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.670
involved in the phases of

22
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.695
the incident
response lifecycle.

23
00:00:45.695 --> 00:00:47.780
You learned about
techniques related to

24
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:49.880
incident detection and analysis.

25
00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.080
You also learned about

26
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.180
documentation like
chain of custody,

27
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.505
playbooks, and final reports.

28
00:00:55.505 --> 00:00:57.829
We ended with
exploring strategies

29
00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:00.760
used for recovery and
post-incident activity.

30
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:03.750
Finally, you learned how to
interpret logs and alerts.

31
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.125
You explored Suricata
on the command line

32
00:01:06.125 --> 00:01:08.720
to read and understand
signatures and rules.

33
00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.120
You also used SIEM
tools like Splunk and

34
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.890
Chronicle to search
for events and logs.

35
00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:15.565
As a security analyst,

36
00:01:15.565 --> 00:01:18.535
you'll be presented with a
new challenge every day.

37
00:01:18.535 --> 00:01:20.620
Whether it's
investigating evidence

38
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:22.030
or documenting your work,

39
00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.950
you'll use what you've
learned in this course

40
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:26.110
to effectively
respond to incidents.

41
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.580
I'm so glad to have been on

42
00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.200
this learning journey with you.

43
00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.700
You've done a fantastic job

44
00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.080
in expanding your knowledge and

45
00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.229
learning new tools to add
to your security toolbox.

46
00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:37.000
One of the things I love about

47
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.350
the security field
is that there's

48
00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:40.145
always something new to learn.

49
00:01:40.145 --> 00:01:42.595
And coming up, you'll continue
your learning journey

50
00:01:42.595 --> 00:01:45.250
by exploring a programming
language called Python,

51
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:48.130
which can be used to
automate security tasks.

52
00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.450
Keep up the great work!
