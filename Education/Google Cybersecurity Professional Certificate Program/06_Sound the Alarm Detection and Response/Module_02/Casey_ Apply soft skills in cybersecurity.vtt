Hi, my name is Casey
and I'm part of

2
00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:09.165
the Google Cloud Enterprise
Security sales team.

3
00:00:09.165 --> 00:00:11.700
First of all, the biggest piece

4
00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.715
of advice I can give is: do it.

5
00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:16.440
I want you to be here.

6
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.820
We need all the people.

7
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:19.795
It's a non-stop,

8
00:00:19.795 --> 00:00:22.649
ever-changing world
in cybersecurity,

9
00:00:22.649 --> 00:00:24.945
which is why it's such
a fun place to be.

10
00:00:24.945 --> 00:00:27.960
We need more diversity
in security.

11
00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:29.895
We need everybody participating.

12
00:00:29.895 --> 00:00:32.670
We need people with
diversity of thought,

13
00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:36.140
diversity of backgrounds,
diversity of perspectives.

14
00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:38.320
I think some of the most
important soft skills in

15
00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:40.530
cybersecurity are, number 1,

16
00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:42.860
being able to clearly

17
00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:46.910
summarize what you're trying
to say, massively important.

18
00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:49.490
One of the other
soft skills that I

19
00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:52.250
think could even be more

20
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:54.245
important than
clear communication

21
00:00:54.245 --> 00:00:58.265
is working with an open mindset.

22
00:00:58.265 --> 00:01:02.805
The threat landscape is
continuously changing.

23
00:01:02.805 --> 00:01:05.180
The threat actors,
the bad actors,

24
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.065
they never sleep,
and so neither can we.

25
00:01:08.065 --> 00:01:11.105
One of the things that
makes cybersecurity so fun,

26
00:01:11.105 --> 00:01:13.805
in my opinion, is because
it changes constantly.

27
00:01:13.805 --> 00:01:16.895
And if we have a fixed
mindset going in,

28
00:01:16.895 --> 00:01:19.340
and what I mean by
a fixed mindset is,

29
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:20.920
I think I know the
answer to this,

30
00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:23.495
I think I understand
exactly what's going on,

31
00:01:23.495 --> 00:01:26.120
we are absolutely going
to miss the boat.

32
00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:29.760
We need to be able to
always stay curious.

33
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:31.910
And from a cybersecurity
point of view,

34
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.885
it's very important to
leave no stone unturned.

35
00:01:35.885 --> 00:01:37.430
One of the best things about

36
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.170
soft skills is that we all have

37
00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.740
them and we're already using
them every single day.

38
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.870
So every one of you that's watching

39
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.270
this already has a head
start in cybersecurity.
