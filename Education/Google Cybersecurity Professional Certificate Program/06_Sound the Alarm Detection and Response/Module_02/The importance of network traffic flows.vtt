00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:04.502
In many organizations, network
communication travels over multiple

2
00:00:04.502 --> 00:00:07.793
networks in different countries and
across different devices.

3
00:00:07.793 --> 00:00:11.897
Data can get unintentionally sent and
stored in insecure places,

4
00:00:11.897 --> 00:00:15.493
like personal email inboxes or
cloud storage platforms.

5
00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:19.574
Users trust that their data is safely and
securely sent and stored.

6
00:00:19.574 --> 00:00:24.014
And it's the job of security professionals
like you to help protect these

7
00:00:24.014 --> 00:00:26.465
communications in transit and at rest.

8
00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:30.793
Previously, you may recall learning how
to identify and secure critical assets

9
00:00:30.793 --> 00:00:34.621
through security controls like data
classification and encryption.

10
00:00:34.621 --> 00:00:39.598
Coming up, we'll expand on this topic and
examine how network traffic analysis can

11
00:00:39.598 --> 00:00:44.445
be used to monitor network activity and
identify potential malicious activity.

12
00:00:45.445 --> 00:00:46.021
So what is network traffic?

13
00:00:46.021 --> 00:00:49.637
Network traffic is the amount of
data that moves across a network.

14
00:00:49.637 --> 00:00:54.105
While network data is the data that's
transmitted between devices on a network.

15
00:00:55.105 --> 00:00:55.890
Depending on the size of a network,

16
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.170
there can be a huge volume of
network traffic at any given moment.

17
00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:02.989
For example, in a large,
multinational organization, there may

18
00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:07.217
be thousands of employees sending and
receiving emails at any given time.

19
00:01:07.217 --> 00:01:08.938
That's a lot of network traffic.

20
00:01:08.938 --> 00:01:11.823
With such large volumes of
traffic being produced,

21
00:01:11.823 --> 00:01:15.365
how do you know what's normal behavior,
or what's unusual and

22
00:01:15.365 --> 00:01:18.728
requires investigation as
a potential security incident?

23
00:01:19.728 --> 00:01:23.204
Imagine being stuck in unexpected traffic
during your regular drive to work.

24
00:01:23.204 --> 00:01:27.783
And, as you move along, you realize
something unusual caused the traffic,

25
00:01:27.783 --> 00:01:32.012
like a minor vehicle collision which
slowed down the expected flow.

26
00:01:32.012 --> 00:01:32.712
On the road,

27
00:01:32.712 --> 00:01:37.384
we have certain expectations about traffic
flows based on our commuting experience.

28
00:01:37.384 --> 00:01:41.892
Peak traffic patterns like morning and
evening rush are normal and expected,

29
00:01:41.892 --> 00:01:45.992
while abnormal traffic during
off-peak times reveals that something

30
00:01:45.992 --> 00:01:49.150
unexpected has happened,
like a vehicle collision.

31
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:51.394
Network traffic works in the same way.

32
00:01:51.394 --> 00:01:54.943
By understanding how data should
be flowing across the network,

33
00:01:54.943 --> 00:01:58.700
you can develop an understanding
of expected network traffic flow.

34
00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:02.873
By knowing what's normal,
you can easily spot what's abnormal.

35
00:02:02.873 --> 00:02:07.813
We can detect traffic abnormalities
through observation to spot indicators

36
00:02:07.813 --> 00:02:12.373
of compromise, also known as IoC,
which are observable evidence that

37
00:02:12.373 --> 00:02:15.646
suggests signs of a potential
security incident.

38
00:02:16.646 --> 00:02:18.052
Take, for instance, data exfiltration,

39
00:02:18.052 --> 00:02:21.506
which is the unauthorized
transmission of data from a system.

40
00:02:21.506 --> 00:02:25.758
Attackers use data exfiltration to
steal or leak data such as user names,

41
00:02:25.758 --> 00:02:28.170
passwords, or intellectual property.

42
00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.644
By observing network traffic, we can
determine if there's any indicators of

43
00:02:32.644 --> 00:02:36.793
compromise, such as large volumes
of outbound traffic leaving a host.

44
00:02:36.793 --> 00:02:40.533
This is a sign of possible
data exfiltration which can be

45
00:02:40.533 --> 00:02:42.211
further investigated.

46
00:02:43.211 --> 00:02:44.879
Understanding and
monitoring network traffic for

47
00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:48.919
inconsistencies is an important aspect
of a security professional's job.

48
00:02:48.919 --> 00:02:49.586
Coming up,

49
00:02:49.586 --> 00:02:53.671
we'll explore what a data exfiltration
attack looks like in real-time.

50
00:02:53.671 --> 00:02:54.610
Meet you there.
