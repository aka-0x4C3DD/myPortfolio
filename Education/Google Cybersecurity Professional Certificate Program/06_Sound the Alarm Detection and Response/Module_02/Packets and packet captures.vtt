00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.210
Whether it's an employee
sending an email or

2
00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.620
a malicious actor attempting

3
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.705
to exfiltrate confidential data,

4
00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:09.060
actions that are performed
on a network can be

5
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.285
identified through examining
network traffic flows.

6
00:00:13.285 --> 00:00:14.895
Understanding these network
communications provides

7
00:00:14.895 --> 00:00:16.815
valuable insight
into the activities

8
00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:18.510
happening in a network.

9
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.060
This way, you can better
understand what's going on in

10
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:24.370
an environment and defend
against potential threats.

11
00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.450
With this in mind,
let's examine how to

12
00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:29.345
record network traffic
through packet captures.

13
00:00:30.345 --> 00:00:31.400
Previously in the program,

14
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:32.435
you learned that
when data is sent,

15
00:00:32.435 --> 00:00:34.130
it's divided into packets.

16
00:00:34.130 --> 00:00:36.215
Just like an addressed
envelope in the mail,

17
00:00:36.215 --> 00:00:38.330
packets contain delivery
information which

18
00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.985
is used to route it
to its destination.

19
00:00:41.985 --> 00:00:42.890
This information
includes a sender

20
00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:44.675
and receiver's IP address,

21
00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:47.425
the type of packet that's
being sent, and more.

22
00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:49.970
Packets can provide lots
of information about

23
00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:51.650
the communications
happening between

24
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.530
devices over a network.

25
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.920
You may also recall that

26
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:57.005
a packet has
multiple components.

27
00:00:57.005 --> 00:00:59.150
There's the header, which
includes information like

28
00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.835
the type of network protocol
and port being used.

29
00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:03.830
Imagine this as
being the name and

30
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.350
mailing address located
on an envelope.

31
00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.350
Network protocols are a set
of rules that determine

32
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.785
the transmission of data
between devices on a network.

33
00:01:12.785 --> 00:01:15.875
Ports are non-physical
locations on a computer

34
00:01:15.875 --> 00:01:17.540
that organize data transmission

35
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.385
between devices on a network.

36
00:01:20.385 --> 00:01:20.930
The header also contains

37
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.870
the packet's source and
destination IP address.

38
00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:25.520
We'll explore more information

39
00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.010
contained in the header
in a later section.

40
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.170
Next, there's the payload, which

41
00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.735
contains the actual data
that's being delivered.

42
00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:34.220
This is like the content of

43
00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.140
a letter inside of an envelope.

44
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.265
And there's the footer,

45
00:01:37.265 --> 00:01:39.475
which signifies the
end of the packet.

46
00:01:40.475 --> 00:01:42.485
So how exactly can you
observe a network packet?

47
00:01:42.485 --> 00:01:45.620
Just like scents are invisible
but can be smelled,

48
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.270
packets are invisible but can be

49
00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:50.000
captured using tools
called packet sniffers.

50
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.315
You may remember packet sniffers
from a previous section.

51
00:01:53.315 --> 00:01:56.180
A network protocol analyzer,
or packet sniffer,

52
00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:57.830
is a tool designed
to capture and

53
00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:00.515
analyze data traffic
within a network.

54
00:02:00.515 --> 00:02:02.015
As a security analyst,

55
00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:03.890
you'll use packet
sniffers to inspect

56
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.200
packets for indicators
of compromise.

57
00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.600
Through packet sniffing, we can grab
a detailed snapshot of

58
00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:10.670
packets that travel over

59
00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:13.175
a network in the form
of a packet capture.

60
00:02:13.175 --> 00:02:16.310
A packet capture,
or P-cap, is a file

61
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.500
containing data
packets intercepted

62
00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.195
from an interface or network.

63
00:02:20.195 --> 00:02:23.345
It's sort of like intercepting
an envelope in the mail.

64
00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:25.580
Packet captures are
incredibly useful

65
00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.680
during incident investigation.

66
00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.600
By having access to
the communications

67
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.925
happening between
devices over a network,

68
00:02:31.925 --> 00:02:34.550
you can observe network
interactions and start to build

69
00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:37.670
a storyline to determine
what exactly happened.

70
00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.800
Coming up, we'll
discuss the importance

71
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:42.780
of packet analysis.
Meet you there.
