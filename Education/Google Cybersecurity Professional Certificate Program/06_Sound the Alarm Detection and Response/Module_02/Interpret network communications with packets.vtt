00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:04.470
If a packet capture is like
intercepting an envelope in the mail,

2
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:08.460
then packet analysis is like reading
the letter inside of the envelope.

3
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:11.746
Let's discuss how analyzing
packets can help us interpret and

4
00:00:11.746 --> 00:00:13.792
understand network communications.

5
00:00:14.792 --> 00:00:15.830
As you may know, networks are noisy.

6
00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.877
There's an enormous volume of
communications happening between devices

7
00:00:19.877 --> 00:00:20.970
at any given time.

8
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.097
And because of this, packet captures
can contain large amounts of network

9
00:00:25.097 --> 00:00:29.510
communications, making analysis
challenging and time-consuming.

10
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:33.309
As a security professional, you'll be
working against the clock to protect

11
00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.170
networks and
computer systems from potential attacks.

12
00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.561
You may analyze network evidence in
the form of packet captures to identify

13
00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:42.270
indicators of compromise.

14
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:46.590
Having the ability to filter network
traffic using packet sniffers to gather

15
00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:49.810
relevant information
is an essential skill to have.

16
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:54.119
For example, let's say that you were
tasked with analyzing a packet capture

17
00:00:54.119 --> 00:00:56.720
to find any indication
of data exfiltration.

18
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:58.750
How would you go about this?

19
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:03.290
Using a network analyzer tool, you can
filter the packet capture to sort packets.

20
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.853
This can help you quickly identify an
event associated with data exfiltration,

21
00:01:07.853 --> 00:01:10.640
like large amounts of
data leaving a database.

22
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.867
There are many other filters you can apply
to packet captures to find the information

23
00:01:14.867 --> 00:01:18.340
you need to support
an investigation efficiently.

24
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.640
Examples of network analyzer tools
include tcpdump and Wireshark.

25
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.500
tcpdump is accessed through a command
line while Wireshark has a graphical user

26
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.690
interface, or GUI.

27
00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.315
Both tools are useful for
security analysts, and

28
00:01:31.315 --> 00:01:34.220
soon you'll have
the opportunity to explore both.

29
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:38.708
Before we begin using these tools,
let's explore packet fields in detail,

30
00:01:38.708 --> 00:01:40.290
specifically, IP headers.

31
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.805
Meet you there.
