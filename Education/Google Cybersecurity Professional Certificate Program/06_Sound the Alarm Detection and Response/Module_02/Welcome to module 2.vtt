00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.690
Welcome back! I'm so
glad you're joining us.

2
00:00:03.690 --> 00:00:05.310
Previously, you
were introduced to

3
00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.335
incident detection and response.

4
00:00:07.335 --> 00:00:09.150
You may also remember
learning about

5
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.385
networking from a
previous course.

6
00:00:12.385 --> 00:00:12.945
To recap, you learned about

7
00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:14.430
how devices talk to each other

8
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.990
using network protocols and

9
00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.015
the different types
of network attacks.

10
00:00:18.015 --> 00:00:21.430
You also examined some network
security best practices.

11
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.490
Here, we'll expand
on networking and

12
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.950
shift our focus to
network analysis.

13
00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.090
First, you'll examine

14
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:28.350
network communications by

15
00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.270
exploring network traffic flows.

16
00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.100
Next, you'll learn
about viewing and

17
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.830
capturing network traffic
using packet sniffers.

18
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:37.035
Then, you'll be introduced
to packet analysis,

19
00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:39.540
where you'll examine
packet fields and decode

20
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:42.340
communication between
devices and networks.

21
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:44.105
As a security professional,

22
00:00:44.105 --> 00:00:46.340
you'll be tasked with
monitoring networks and

23
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:49.885
system infrastructure to
detect malicious activities.

24
00:00:49.885 --> 00:00:52.400
And this section will provide
you with the opportunity to

25
00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.115
develop your network and
packet analysis skills.

26
00:00:55.115 --> 00:00:58.500
Are you ready to begin?
Let's get started!
