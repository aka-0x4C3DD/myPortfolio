00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.280
Nice work so far!

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.110
Congratulations on capturing

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:06.075
and analyzing your first packet.

4
00:00:06.075 --> 00:00:08.520
Let's review what
we've covered so far.

5
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:11.130
First, you learned how
network traffic flows

6
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.860
provide valuable
communications insight.

7
00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.720
Through monitoring
network activity

8
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.430
for indicators of compromise,

9
00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.585
you learned how to spot

10
00:00:18.585 --> 00:00:21.805
unusual network activity,
like data exfiltration.

11
00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:23.900
Then, you learned how
to view and capture

12
00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:26.344
network traffic using
packet sniffers.

13
00:00:27.344 --> 00:00:28.040
Finally, you learned
how to inspect

14
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.095
packets through packet analysis.

15
00:00:30.095 --> 00:00:32.360
You dissected packet
header data fields

16
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:34.895
and analyzed packet
captures in detail.

17
00:00:35.895 --> 00:00:36.290
You've made a lot of progress

18
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:37.700
in developing the skills you'll

19
00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.790
need to prepare for an
entry-level role in security.

20
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:42.620
Coming up, you'll
be immersed into

21
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.335
the exciting world of
incident investigation,

22
00:00:45.335 --> 00:00:48.260
where you'll examine the
processes behind detecting

23
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:51.720
and containing an incident.
I'll meet you there.
