00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.375
While there are many different
tools available to use,

2
00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:05.910
it's important as a security
analyst that you learn

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.655
how to read and analyze
packets manually.

4
00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:10.200
To do so, let's examine

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:13.095
an important packet
component: IP headers.

6
00:00:14.095 --> 00:00:14.760
Previously, you learned about

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.355
the four layers of
the TCP/IP model.

8
00:00:17.355 --> 00:00:20.910
Remember, the TCP/IP model is
a framework that is used to

9
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.290
visualize how data is

10
00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:25.035
organized and transmitted
across a network.

11
00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:26.970
The internet layer accepts and

12
00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:28.725
delivers packets
for the network.

13
00:00:28.725 --> 00:00:31.590
It's also the layer where the
Internet Protocol operates

14
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.515
as the foundation for all
communications on the internet.

15
00:00:34.515 --> 00:00:36.060
It's responsible for making

16
00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:38.485
sure packets reach
their destinations.

17
00:00:39.485 --> 00:00:40.460
The Internet Protocol
operates like

18
00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.500
a mail courier
delivering an envelope.

19
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.690
Instead of using the
delivery information

20
00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:45.815
found on the envelope,

21
00:00:45.815 --> 00:00:48.110
the Internet Protocol
uses the information

22
00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:50.890
found in a packet header,
like IP addresses.

23
00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:53.150
It then determines the
best available route

24
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.380
for packets to take,

25
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.760
so that data can be sent
and received between hosts.

26
00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:59.105
As you may already know,

27
00:00:59.105 --> 00:01:00.980
IP packets contain headers.

28
00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.320
Headers contain the data
fields essential to

29
00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.175
the transfer of data to
its intended destination.

30
00:01:06.175 --> 00:01:08.745
Different protocols
use different headers.

31
00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:10.340
There are two
different versions of

32
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:13.025
the Internet Protocol: IPv4,

33
00:01:13.025 --> 00:01:14.060
which is considered to be

34
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.355
the foundation of
internet communications,

35
00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:18.170
and IPv6, which is

36
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.740
the most recent version
of the Internet Protocol.

37
00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:23.990
Remember, different protocols
use different headers.

38
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.365
So IPv4 and IPv6 headers differ,

39
00:01:27.365 --> 00:01:30.865
but they contain similar
fields with different names.

40
00:01:30.865 --> 00:01:33.560
IPv4 is still the
most widely used,

41
00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:37.780
so we'll focus on examining
the fields of an IPv4 header.

42
00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:39.935
Let's start with the
Version field, which

43
00:01:39.935 --> 00:01:42.995
specifies which version
of IP is being used,

44
00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:46.360
either IPv4 or IPv6.

45
00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.975
Referring back to
our mail analogy,

46
00:01:48.975 --> 00:01:51.740
the Version field is like the
different classes of mail,

47
00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.800
like priority,
express, or regular.

48
00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.030
Next, IHL stands for
Internet Header Length.

49
00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:00.950
This field specifies
the length of

50
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.595
the IP header plus any options.

51
00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:07.315
The next field, ToS stands
for Type of Service.

52
00:02:07.315 --> 00:02:08.630
This field tells us if

53
00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.675
certain packets should be
treated with different care.

54
00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:14.090
For example, think of ToS like

55
00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:17.014
a fragile sticker on
a mailed package.

56
00:02:18.014 --> 00:02:19.130
Next is the Total Length field,

57
00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:21.710
which identifies the length
of the entire packet,

58
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:24.355
including the headers
and the data.

59
00:02:24.355 --> 00:02:26.810
This can be compared
to the dimensions

60
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.550
and weight of an envelope.

61
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.185
The next three fields,

62
00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:31.850
Identification, Flags,

63
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:33.110
and Fragment Offset,

64
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.650
deal with information
related to fragmentation.

65
00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:39.290
Fragmentation is
when an IP packet

66
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:40.970
gets broken up into chunks,

67
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.340
which then get transmitted
over the wire and

68
00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:46.085
reassembled when they arrive
at their destination.

69
00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:49.400
These three fields specify
if fragmentation has been

70
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.424
used and how to reassemble

71
00:02:51.424 --> 00:02:53.765
the broken packets in
the correct order.

72
00:02:53.765 --> 00:02:55.940
This is similar to
how mail can travel

73
00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.250
through multiple
routes like mailboxes,

74
00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.500
processing facilities,
airplanes, and

75
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.310
mail trucks before it
reaches its destination.

76
00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:05.800
The TTL field stands
for Time to Live.

77
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:07.325
Like its name suggests,

78
00:03:07.325 --> 00:03:08.900
this field determines how long

79
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:11.220
a packet can live
before it gets dropped.

80
00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:12.820
Without this field,
packets could

81
00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.735
loop through routers endlessly.

82
00:03:14.735 --> 00:03:17.650
TTL is similar to how
tracking information

83
00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:18.880
provides details about

84
00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.160
an envelope's expected
delivery date.

85
00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.950
The Protocol field specifies
the protocol used by

86
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:26.950
providing a value which
corresponds to a protocol.

87
00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.520
For example, TCP is
represented by 6.

88
00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.635
This is similar to
including the number

89
00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:34.865
of a house in a postal address.

90
00:03:35.865 --> 00:03:37.825
The Header Checksum stores
a value called a checksum,

91
00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:39.550
which is used to determine if

92
00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:41.620
any errors have
occurred in the header.

93
00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.130
The Source Address specifies
the source IP address and

94
00:03:45.130 --> 00:03:47.125
the Destination
Address specifies

95
00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:49.015
the destination IP address.

96
00:03:49.015 --> 00:03:50.680
This is just like the sender and

97
00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.185
receiver's contact information
found on an envelope.

98
00:03:55.185 --> 00:03:57.620
The Options field is not
required and is commonly

99
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.059
used for network troubleshooting

100
00:03:59.059 --> 00:04:00.635
rather than common traffic.

101
00:04:00.635 --> 00:04:03.455
If it's used, the header
length increases.

102
00:04:03.455 --> 00:04:06.490
It's like purchasing postal
insurance for an envelope.

103
00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:08.420
Finally, at the end
of the packet header

104
00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.400
is where the packet's
data resides,

105
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.425
like the text in
an email message.

106
00:04:13.425 --> 00:04:14.420
Who knew that the
packets of data we send

107
00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:16.945
across networks contain
so much information?

108
00:04:16.945 --> 00:04:18.890
Coming up soon, you'll
have the opportunity to

109
00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.020
examine these packet
fields in detail.
