00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.730
Monitoring network traffic

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.680
helps security
professionals detect,

3
00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.065
prevent, and respond
to attacks.

4
00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:09.524
In my experience as a
security professional,

5
00:00:09.524 --> 00:00:11.250
monitoring for deviations from

6
00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.475
typical network traffic patterns
has yielded big results.

7
00:00:14.475 --> 00:00:16.439
Even if information
is encrypted,

8
00:00:16.439 --> 00:00:18.120
monitoring network
traffic is still

9
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.340
important for security purposes.

10
00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.710
Let's discuss how the
detection and response

11
00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.515
process might work in a
data exfiltration attack.

12
00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:28.079
First, we'll outline the
attacker's perspective.

13
00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:30.885
Before attackers can
perform data exfiltration,

14
00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:32.460
they'll need to
gain initial access

15
00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.440
into a network and
computer system.

16
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.910
This can be done
through a social

17
00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:37.500
engineering attack
like phishing,

18
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.765
which tricks people into
disclosing sensitive data.

19
00:00:40.765 --> 00:00:43.640
Attackers can send phishing
emails with attachments or

20
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.440
links that trick their target

21
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.180
into entering their credentials.

22
00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:48.530
Now, an attacker has

23
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.810
successfully gained
access to their device.

24
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:52.970
After gaining their
initial position into

25
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:55.250
the system, an attacker
won't stop there.

26
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.130
The goal for attackers
is to maintain access in

27
00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.600
the environment and avoid being

28
00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.570
detected for as
long as possible.

29
00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:03.275
To do this, they'll perform

30
00:01:03.275 --> 00:01:05.990
a tactic known as lateral
movement, or pivoting.

31
00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:07.400
This is when they'll spend time

32
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:09.200
exploring the network
with the goal of

33
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.060
expanding and
maintaining their access

34
00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.800
to other systems on the network.

35
00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:14.705
As an attacker pivots
in the network,

36
00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:16.130
they'll scope out
the environment

37
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.885
to identify valuable assets,

38
00:01:17.885 --> 00:01:20.840
such as sensitive data
like proprietary code,

39
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.000
personally identifiable
information like

40
00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.610
names and addresses,
or financial records.

41
00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.110
They'll do this by searching

42
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.345
locations such as
network file shares,

43
00:01:29.345 --> 00:01:32.720
intranet sites, code
repositories, and more.

44
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.705
After the attacker identifies
the assets of value,

45
00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:37.580
they'll need to
collect, package,

46
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.310
and prepare the data for
exfiltration outside of

47
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.045
the organization's network and
into the attacker's hands.

48
00:01:44.045 --> 00:01:47.375
One way they may do this is
by reducing the data size.

49
00:01:47.375 --> 00:01:48.860
This helps attackers hide

50
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.710
the stolen data and
bypass security controls.

51
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:53.690
Finally, the attacker
will exfiltrate

52
00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:56.125
the data to their
destination of choice.

53
00:01:56.125 --> 00:01:58.500
There are many ways to
do this. For example,

54
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:00.680
attackers can email
the stolen data to

55
00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.950
themselves using the
compromised email account.

56
00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.829
Now that you've tapped into
the attacker's perspective,

57
00:02:06.829 --> 00:02:08.780
let's explore how organizations

58
00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.030
can defend against
this type of attack.

59
00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.020
First, security teams must
prevent attacker access.

60
00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.910
There are many methods
you can use to

61
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:18.980
protect your network
from phishing attempts.

62
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.825
For example, requiring users

63
00:02:20.825 --> 00:02:23.150
to use multi-factor
authentication.

64
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.535
Attackers that gain
access to a network

65
00:02:25.535 --> 00:02:27.890
can remain unnoticed
for a while.

66
00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:29.705
It's important that
security teams

67
00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:31.370
monitor network activity to

68
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:33.454
identify any suspicious activity

69
00:02:33.454 --> 00:02:35.225
that can indicate a compromise.

70
00:02:35.225 --> 00:02:38.240
For example, multiple
user logins coming from

71
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.740
IP addresses outside of

72
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.675
the network should
be investigated.

73
00:02:42.675 --> 00:02:44.720
Earlier, you examined how
to identify, classify,

74
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.250
and protect assets using

75
00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.850
asset inventories and
security controls.

76
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:51.440
As part of an organization's
security policy,

77
00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.740
all assets should be cataloged
in an asset inventory.

78
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:57.590
The appropriate security
controls should also be applied

79
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.680
to protect these assets
from unauthorized access.

80
00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.800
Lastly, if a data exfiltration
attack is successful,

81
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.055
security teams must detect
and stop the exfiltration.

82
00:03:07.055 --> 00:03:08.405
To detect the attack,

83
00:03:08.405 --> 00:03:10.670
indicators of unusual
data collection can

84
00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.205
be identified through
network monitoring.

85
00:03:13.205 --> 00:03:16.370
These include: large
internal file transfers,

86
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.020
large external uploads,

87
00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.185
and unexpected file writes.

88
00:03:21.185 --> 00:03:23.555
SIEM tools can detect an
alert on these activities.

89
00:03:23.555 --> 00:03:25.340
Once an alert has been sent out,

90
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.080
security teams investigate and

91
00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.925
stop the attack from continuing.

92
00:03:28.925 --> 00:03:31.505
There are many ways to
stop an attack like this.

93
00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:34.580
For instance, once the unusual
activity is identified,

94
00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.245
you can block the IP addresses

95
00:03:36.245 --> 00:03:39.410
associated with the attacker
using firewall rules.

96
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:42.080
Data exfiltration
attacks are just one of

97
00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.220
many attacks that can be

98
00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:45.230
detected through
network monitoring.

99
00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.210
Coming up, you'll learn
how to monitor and

100
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:51.120
analyze network communications
using packet sniffers.
