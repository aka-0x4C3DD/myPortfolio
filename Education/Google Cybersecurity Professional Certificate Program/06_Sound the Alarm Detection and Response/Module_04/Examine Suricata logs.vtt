00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.426
Now let's examine some logs
generated by Suricata.

2
00:00:04.426 --> 00:00:09.710
In Suricata, alerts and events are output
in a format known as EVE JSON.

3
00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.022
EVE stands for Extensible Event Format and
JSON stands for

4
00:00:14.022 --> 00:00:16.310
JavaScript Object Notation.

5
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.379
As you previously learned, JSON uses
key-value pairs, which simplifies both

6
00:00:22.379 --> 00:00:25.590
searching and
extracting text from log files.

7
00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:31.654
Suricata generates two types of log data:
alert logs and network telemetry logs.

8
00:00:31.654 --> 00:00:36.320
Alert logs contain information that's
relevant to security investigations.

9
00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:39.900
Usually this is the output of signatures
which have triggered an alert.

10
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.205
For example, a signature that detects
suspicious traffic across the network

11
00:00:44.205 --> 00:00:48.260
generates an alert log that
captures details of that traffic.

12
00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.624
While network telemetry logs contain
information about network traffic flows,

13
00:00:52.624 --> 00:00:57.175
network telemetry is not always security
relevant, it's simply recording what's

14
00:00:57.175 --> 00:01:01.370
happening on a network, such as a
connection being made to a specific port.

15
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:05.066
Both of these log types provide
information to build a story during

16
00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.570
an investigation.

17
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:09.350
Let's examine an example
of both log types.

18
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:11.510
Here's an example of an event log.

19
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:16.690
We can tell that this event is an alert
because the event type field says alert.

20
00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.150
There's also details about the activity
that was logged including IP addresses and

21
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.270
the protocol.

22
00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:27.670
There are also details about the signature
itself, such as the message and id.

23
00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:29.218
From the signature's message,

24
00:01:29.218 --> 00:01:32.441
it appears that this alert relates
to the detection of malware.

25
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.804
Next up, we have an example of
a network telemetry log, which shows us

26
00:01:37.804 --> 00:01:41.260
the details of an http
request to a website.

27
00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.640
The event type field tells
us it's an http log.

28
00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:46.572
There's details about the request.

29
00:01:46.572 --> 00:01:50.020
Under hostname,
there's the website that was accessed.

30
00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:54.180
The user agent is the name of software
that connects you to the website.

31
00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.880
In this case,
it's the web browser Mozilla 5.0.

32
00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:01.901
And the content type, which is the data
the http request returned.

33
00:02:01.901 --> 00:02:05.382
Here it's specified as HTML text.

34
00:02:06.382 --> 00:02:08.194
That sums it up on the different
types of log outputs.

35
00:02:08.194 --> 00:02:09.610
In the upcoming activity,

36
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:13.618
you'll be applying what we just explored
by getting hands-on with Suricata.

37
00:02:13.618 --> 00:02:14.346
Have fun!
