00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.175
As a security analyst,

2
00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:03.990
you may be tasked with writing,

3
00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:06.405
customizing, or
testing signatures.

4
00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.850
To do this, you'll
use IDS tools.

5
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.815
So in this section, we'll examine

6
00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:12.855
signature syntax and by the end,

7
00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:15.015
you'll be able to
read a signature.

8
00:00:16.015 --> 00:00:17.790
A signature specifies
detection rules.

9
00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:19.620
These rules outline
the types of

10
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.740
network intrusions you
want an IDS to detect.

11
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.390
For example, a signature can

12
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:25.920
be written to detect and alert

13
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.460
on suspicious traffic attempting
to connect to a port.

14
00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.650
Rule language
differs depending on

15
00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.180
different network intrusion
detection systems.

16
00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.555
The term network intrusion
detection system

17
00:00:36.555 --> 00:00:37.770
is often abbreviated

18
00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:41.865
as the acronym N-I-D-S
and pronounced NIDS.

19
00:00:41.865 --> 00:00:45.035
Generally, NIDS rules
consists of three components:

20
00:00:45.035 --> 00:00:48.595
an action, a header,
and rule options.

21
00:00:48.595 --> 00:00:50.060
Now, let's examine each of

22
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.475
these three components
in more detail.

23
00:00:53.475 --> 00:00:54.140
Typically, the action is

24
00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:56.840
the first item specified
in a signature.

25
00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:58.970
This determines the
action to take if

26
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.435
the rule criteria
matches are met.

27
00:01:01.435 --> 00:01:04.370
Actions differ across
NIDS rule languages,

28
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:08.915
but some common actions are:
alert, pass, or reject.

29
00:01:09.915 --> 00:01:12.500
Using our example, if a
rule specifies to alert on

30
00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.480
suspicious network traffic that

31
00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:16.910
establishes an unusual
connection to a port,

32
00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:18.380
the IDS will inspect

33
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:21.070
the traffic packets
and send out an alert.

34
00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.290
The header defines the
signature's network traffic.

35
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.255
These include
information such as

36
00:01:26.255 --> 00:01:28.714
source and destination
IP addresses,

37
00:01:28.714 --> 00:01:30.979
source and destination ports,

38
00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:33.965
protocols, and
traffic direction.

39
00:01:34.965 --> 00:01:36.320
If we want to
detect an alert on

40
00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.555
suspicious traffic
connecting to a port,

41
00:01:38.555 --> 00:01:40.640
we have to first
define the source

42
00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.905
of the suspicious
traffic in the header.

43
00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:45.110
Suspicious traffic
can originate from

44
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.690
IP addresses outside
the local network.

45
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:51.140
It can also use specific
or unusual protocols.

46
00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.705
We can specify
external IP addresses

47
00:01:53.705 --> 00:01:55.835
and these protocols
in the header.

48
00:01:56.835 --> 00:01:57.500
Here's an example of how

49
00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.695
header information may
appear in a basic rule.

50
00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:03.170
First, we can observe
that the protocol,

51
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.955
TCP, is the first listed
item in the signature.

52
00:02:06.955 --> 00:02:09.285
Next, the source IP address

53
00:02:09.285 --> 00:02:14.585
10.120.170.17 and the
source port number

54
00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:16.820
is specified as being any.

55
00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.160
The arrow in the middle
of the signature

56
00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.820
indicates the direction
of the network traffic.

57
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:24.335
So we know it's originating
from the source IP

58
00:02:24.335 --> 00:02:29.000
10.120.170.17 from any port

59
00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.890
going to the following
destination

60
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:38.925
IP address 133.113.202.181
and destination port 80.

61
00:02:39.925 --> 00:02:41.690
The rule options
lets you customize

62
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.005
signatures with
additional parameters.

63
00:02:44.005 --> 00:02:46.760
There are many different
options available to use.

64
00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.280
For instance, you can
set options to match

65
00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:50.975
the content of a network packet

66
00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:53.000
to detect malicious payloads.

67
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.330
Malicious payloads reside in
a packet's data and perform

68
00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:59.855
malicious activity like
deleting or encrypting data.

69
00:03:00.855 --> 00:03:01.985
Configuring rule options helps

70
00:03:01.985 --> 00:03:03.980
in narrowing down
network traffic,

71
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.385
so you can find exactly
what you're looking for.

72
00:03:06.385 --> 00:03:08.690
Typically, rule options
are separated by

73
00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:11.435
semi-colons and enclosed
in parentheses.

74
00:03:11.435 --> 00:03:13.280
In this example, we can examine

75
00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.140
that the rule options
are enclosed in

76
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.880
a pair of parentheses and are

77
00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.450
also separated with semi-colons.

78
00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:21.895
The first rule option, msg,

79
00:03:21.895 --> 00:03:23.465
which stands for message,

80
00:03:23.465 --> 00:03:25.205
provides the alert's text.

81
00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:27.845
In this case, the alert
will print out the text:

82
00:03:27.845 --> 00:03:29.275
"This is a message."

83
00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:31.175
There's also the option sid,

84
00:03:31.175 --> 00:03:33.095
which stands for signature ID.

85
00:03:33.095 --> 00:03:36.370
This attaches a unique
id to each signature.

86
00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.905
The rev option
stands for revision.

87
00:03:38.905 --> 00:03:41.255
Each time a signature
is updated or changed,

88
00:03:41.255 --> 00:03:42.740
the revision number changes.

89
00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.570
Here, the number 1 means

90
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:47.425
it's the first version
of the signature.

91
00:03:48.425 --> 00:03:50.510
Great! Now you've
developed another skill in

92
00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:53.195
your journey towards
becoming a security analyst:

93
00:03:53.195 --> 00:03:54.845
how to read signatures.

94
00:03:54.845 --> 00:03:56.945
There's so much more to
learn and coming up,

95
00:03:56.945 --> 00:04:00.150
we'll discuss tools
that use signatures.
