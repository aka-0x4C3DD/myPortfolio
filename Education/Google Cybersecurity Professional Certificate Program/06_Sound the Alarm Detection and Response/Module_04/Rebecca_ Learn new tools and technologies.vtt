2
00:00:04.512 --> 00:00:08.153
I am Rebecca,
I'm a security engineer at Google, and

3
00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:10.379
I focus in identity management.

4
00:00:10.379 --> 00:00:13.652
The best part of the job is
probably thinking like an attacker.

5
00:00:13.652 --> 00:00:18.196
I love that part of seeing how can
I break stuff, seeing a system and

6
00:00:18.196 --> 00:00:20.564
figuring out how can I get into it.

7
00:00:20.564 --> 00:00:22.827
If I was a bad guy,
what would I be wanting?

8
00:00:22.827 --> 00:00:24.843
What would I be looking for?

9
00:00:24.843 --> 00:00:26.085
How would I find the credentials?

10
00:00:26.085 --> 00:00:31.118
How would I find the machine
that's useful, and get onto it?

11
00:00:31.118 --> 00:00:35.127
My first day in security,
we were learning a new tool.

12
00:00:35.127 --> 00:00:38.981
The whole organization was in a training,
and they're like,

13
00:00:38.981 --> 00:00:40.664
we're going to throw you in.

14
00:00:40.664 --> 00:00:45.539
It's a one week training to
learn a network analyzer.

15
00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.741
I didn't know anything about networks,

16
00:00:48.741 --> 00:00:54.149
let alone network security, or
what this thing was going to be used for.

17
00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.108
And so I was very overwhelmed, because
I felt like I was an imposter sitting

18
00:00:59.108 --> 00:01:02.193
in somebody's seat who
should belong there.

19
00:01:02.193 --> 00:01:04.444
And learning stuff way over my head.

20
00:01:04.444 --> 00:01:09.006
I pushed through it by asking a lot of
questions, and setting aside that feeling

21
00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:13.795
like I should know things, because I've
never been exposed to it at that point.

22
00:01:13.795 --> 00:01:15.729
The only way I'm going to
know is if I ask.

23
00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.858
So, this course has a lot of tools,
and covers a lot of information.

24
00:01:19.858 --> 00:01:24.995
And it can be very easy to be overwhelmed,
in fact, I probably would be as well.

25
00:01:24.995 --> 00:01:29.717
There's a lot of information
that you can take in.

26
00:01:29.717 --> 00:01:34.174
I think of learning in a course like this,
where there's a series of courses for

27
00:01:34.174 --> 00:01:37.113
you to learn,
that it's like climbing a mountain.

28
00:01:37.113 --> 00:01:40.835
You've gotten so far up the mountain,
and the air gets thin, and, yes,

29
00:01:40.835 --> 00:01:41.775
it is difficult.

30
00:01:41.775 --> 00:01:44.660
You feel overwhelmed, but
you're almost to the top.

31
00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:46.665
And know that when you get to the top,

32
00:01:46.665 --> 00:01:49.330
you're going to have
an amazing view of the world.

33
00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.312
And that's the same thing of
when you finish these courses.

34
00:01:52.312 --> 00:01:56.452
Your frame of mind and
how you view things and your capabilities,

35
00:01:56.452 --> 00:02:01.507
your potential for finding new jobs, or
changing careers is that much better.
