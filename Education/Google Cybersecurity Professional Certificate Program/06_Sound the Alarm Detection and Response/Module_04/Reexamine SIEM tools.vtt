00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.212
As a security analyst, you'll need to be
able to quickly access the relevant data

2
00:00:05.212 --> 00:00:07.063
required to perform your duties.

3
00:00:07.063 --> 00:00:10.246
Whether it's triaging alerts,
monitoring systems, or

4
00:00:10.246 --> 00:00:13.380
analyzing log data during
incident investigations,

5
00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.717
a SIEM is the tool for this job.

6
00:00:15.717 --> 00:00:18.824
As a quick review, a SIEM is
an application that collects and

7
00:00:18.824 --> 00:00:23.130
analyzes log data to monitor critical
activities in an organization.

8
00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.623
It does this by collecting, analyzing, and

9
00:00:25.623 --> 00:00:28.677
reporting on security data
from multiple sources.

10
00:00:29.677 --> 00:00:32.470
Previously, you learned about the SIEM
process for data collection.

11
00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:37.169
Let's revisit this process. First, SIEM
tools COLLECT AND PROCESS enormous

12
00:00:37.169 --> 00:00:42.182
amounts of data generated by devices and
systems from all over an environment.

13
00:00:42.182 --> 00:00:44.735
Not all data is the same.
As you already know,

14
00:00:44.735 --> 00:00:47.620
devices generate data
in different formats.

15
00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:52.719
This can be challenging because there is
no unified format to represent the data.

16
00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:55.713
SIEM tools make it easy for
security analysts to read and

17
00:00:55.713 --> 00:00:57.870
analyze data by NORMALIZING it.

18
00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.346
Raw data gets processed, so
that it's formatted consistently and

19
00:01:01.346 --> 00:01:03.882
only relevant event
information is included.

20
00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:08.109
Finally, SIEM tools INDEX the data, so
it can be accessed through search.

21
00:01:08.109 --> 00:01:12.403
All of the events across all the different
sources can be accessed with your

22
00:01:12.403 --> 00:01:13.290
fingertips.

23
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.768
Isn't that useful?

24
00:01:15.768 --> 00:01:17.182
SIEM tools make it easy
to quickly access and

25
00:01:17.182 --> 00:01:21.390
analyze the data flows happening
across networks in an environment.

26
00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:24.871
As a security analyst, you may
encounter different SIEM tools.

27
00:01:24.871 --> 00:01:27.159
It's important that
you're able to adjust and

28
00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:30.680
adapt to whichever tool your
organization ends up using.

29
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.022
With that in mind, let's explore some SIEM
tools currently used in the security

30
00:01:35.022 --> 00:01:35.689
industry.

31
00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:38.060
Splunk is a data analysis platform.

32
00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:42.573
Splunk Enterprise Security provides
SIEM solutions that let you search,

33
00:01:42.573 --> 00:01:44.944
analyze, and visualize security data.

34
00:01:44.944 --> 00:01:49.597
First, it collects data from different
sources. That data gets processed and

35
00:01:49.597 --> 00:01:54.106
stored in an index. Then, it can be
accessed in a variety of different ways,

36
00:01:54.106 --> 00:01:55.479
like through search.

37
00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.720
Chronicle is Google Cloud's SIEM,
which stores security data for

38
00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.243
search, analysis, and visualization.

39
00:02:02.243 --> 00:02:04.720
First, data gets forwarded to Chronicle.

40
00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.750
This data then gets normalized, or cleaned
up, so it's easier to process and index.

41
00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.760
Finally, the data becomes available
to be accessed through a search bar.

42
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.314
Next up, we'll explore how to
search on these SIEM platforms.
