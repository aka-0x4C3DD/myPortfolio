00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:04.080
History books. Receipts. Diaries.

2
00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.360
What do all these things have in common?

3
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.128
They record events. Whether it's
historical events, financial transactions,

4
00:00:11.128 --> 00:00:12.730
or private diary entries,

5
00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.956
records preserve event details.

6
00:00:14.956 --> 00:00:18.690
And having access to these details
can help us in many ways.

7
00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:22.205
Previously, we explored
the different types of processes and

8
00:00:22.205 --> 00:00:26.526
procedures involved during each phase
of the incident response lifecycle.

9
00:00:26.526 --> 00:00:30.996
In this section, we'll direct our focus
on one of the key components of incident investigation,

10
00:00:30.996 --> 00:00:32.980
logs and alerts.

11
00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.397
In security, logs record event details and

12
00:00:35.397 --> 00:00:38.660
these details are used to
support investigations.

13
00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:42.810
First, you'll learn all about logs,
what they are, and how they're created.

14
00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:45.760
You'll also learn how to read and
analyze logs.

15
00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.630
Then, we'll revisit intrusion
detection systems.

16
00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:50.990
You'll explore how to
interpret signatures.

17
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.132
You'll have an opportunity to apply what
you've learned through hands-on activities

18
00:00:55.132 --> 00:00:57.380
using a tool called Suricata.

19
00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.127
Finally, you'll search in
SIEM tools like Splunk and

20
00:01:00.127 --> 00:01:03.251
Chronicle to locate events of interest and
access log data.

21
00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:06.590
Events are a valuable data source.

22
00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:08.921
They help create context
around an alert, so

23
00:01:08.921 --> 00:01:12.170
you can interpret the actions
that took place on a system.

24
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:16.623
Knowing how to read, analyze, and
connect different events will help you

25
00:01:16.623 --> 00:01:20.448
identify malicious behavior and
protect systems from attack.

26
00:01:20.448 --> 00:01:21.680
