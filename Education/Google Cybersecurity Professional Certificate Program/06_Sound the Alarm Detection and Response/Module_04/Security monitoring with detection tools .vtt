1
00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.390
Detection requires data, and

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:06.210
this data can come from
various data sources.

3
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:07.545
You've already explored how

4
00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:09.555
different devices produce logs.

5
00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:12.540
Now we'll examine how different
detection technologies

6
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.920
monitor devices and

7
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:16.080
log different types
of system activity,

8
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.780
like network and
endpoint telemetry.

9
00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:20.760
Telemetry is the collection and

10
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.100
transmission of
data for analysis.

11
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.070
While logs record events
occurring on systems,

12
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.590
telemetry describes
the data itself.

13
00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:30.450
For example, packet captures

14
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.595
are considered
network telemetry.

15
00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:34.290
For security professionals,

16
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.270
logs and telemetry
are sources of

17
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:37.620
evidence that can be used to

18
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.425
answer questions
during investigations.

19
00:00:41.425 --> 00:00:42.380
Previously, you learned about

20
00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:45.080
an intrusion detection
system, or IDS.

21
00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:47.480
Remember that IDS is
an application that

22
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:50.980
monitors activity and alerts
on possible intrusions.

23
00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.120
This includes monitoring
different parts of

24
00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:55.535
a system or network
like an endpoint.

25
00:00:56.535 --> 00:00:57.425
An endpoint is any device

26
00:00:57.425 --> 00:00:59.945
connected on a network,
such as a laptop,

27
00:00:59.945 --> 00:01:03.355
tablet, desktop computer,
or a smartphone.

28
00:01:03.355 --> 00:01:05.210
Endpoints are entry points into

29
00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.504
a network, which makes
them key targets

30
00:01:07.504 --> 00:01:09.365
for malicious actors
looking to gain

31
00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:11.755
unauthorized access
into a system.

32
00:01:12.755 --> 00:01:14.820
To monitor endpoints
for threats or attacks,

33
00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.870
a host-based intrusion
detection system can be used.

34
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:19.700
It's an application
that monitors

35
00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.400
the activity of the host
on which it's installed.

36
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.920
To clarify, a host
is any device that

37
00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.590
communicates with other
devices on a network,

38
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.420
similar to an endpoint.

39
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.850
Host-based intrusion
detection systems

40
00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.175
are installed as an
agent on a single host,

41
00:01:34.175 --> 00:01:36.770
such as a laptop
computer or a server.

42
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.765
Depending on its configuration,

43
00:01:38.765 --> 00:01:40.985
host-based intrusion
detection systems

44
00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:42.170
will monitor the host

45
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.940
on which it's installed to
detect suspicious activity.

46
00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.945
Once something has
been detected,

47
00:01:47.945 --> 00:01:52.115
it records output as logs
and an alert gets generated.

48
00:01:53.115 --> 00:01:54.680
What if we wanted to
monitor a network?

49
00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.530
A network-based intrusion
detection system collects

50
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.485
and analyzes network
traffic and network data.

51
00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:03.020
Network-based intrusion
detection systems

52
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.000
work similar to packet sniffers

53
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.310
because they analyze
network traffic and

54
00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:10.340
network data on a specific
point in the network.

55
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.580
It's common to deploy
multiple IDS sensors at

56
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.960
different points in the network

57
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:17.210
to achieve adequate visibility.

58
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:20.555
When suspicious or unusual
network activity is detected,

59
00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:22.910
the network-based
intrusion detection system

60
00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:24.920
logs it and generates an alert.

61
00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.180
In this example, the

62
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.250
network-based intrusion
detection system is

63
00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.290
monitoring the traffic
that's both coming

64
00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:32.710
from and going to the internet.

65
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.790
Intrusion detection systems use

66
00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:36.875
different types of
detection methods.

67
00:02:36.875 --> 00:02:40.205
One of the most common methods
is signature analysis.

68
00:02:40.205 --> 00:02:42.830
Signature analysis is
a detection method

69
00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:44.930
used to find events
of interest.

70
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.870
A signature specifies
a set of rules that an

71
00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:50.830
IDS refers to when it
monitors activity.

72
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.495
If the activity matches the
rules in the signature,

73
00:02:53.495 --> 00:02:56.290
the IDS logs it and
sends out an alert.

74
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.040
For example, a signature can be

75
00:02:58.040 --> 00:02:59.720
written to generate an alert if

76
00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.125
a failed login on a system
happens three times in a row,

77
00:03:03.125 --> 00:03:06.190
which suggests a possible
password attack.

78
00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:08.030
Before alerts are generated,

79
00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.740
the activity must be logged.

80
00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.415
IDS technologies record the
information of the devices,

81
00:03:13.415 --> 00:03:17.440
systems, and networks which
they monitor as IDS logs.

82
00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:19.880
IDS logs can then
be sent, stored,

83
00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:23.975
and analyzed in a centralized
log repository like a SIEM.

84
00:03:24.975 --> 00:03:26.510
Coming up, we'll
explore how to read and

85
00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.820
configure signatures.
Meet you there!
