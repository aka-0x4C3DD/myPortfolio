1
00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.523
Devices produced data
in the form of events.

2
00:00:03.523 --> 00:00:08.190
As a refresher, events are observable
occurrences that happen on a network

3
00:00:08.190 --> 00:00:09.400
system or device.

4
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.440
This data provides visibility
into an environment.

5
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.027
Logs are one of the key ways security
professionals detect unusual or

6
00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:18.536
malicious activity.

7
00:00:18.536 --> 00:00:23.600
A log is a record of events that
occur within an organization's systems.

8
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.236
System activity is recorded in
what's known as a log file or

9
00:00:27.236 --> 00:00:28.700
commonly called logs.

10
00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:31.802
Almost every device or
system can generate logs.

11
00:00:31.802 --> 00:00:37.093
Logs contain multiple entries which detail
information about a specific event or

12
00:00:37.093 --> 00:00:38.020
occurrence.

13
00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:42.529
Logs are useful to security analysts
during incident investigation since

14
00:00:42.529 --> 00:00:47.260
they record details of what, where, and
when an event occurred on the network.

15
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:52.631
This includes details like date, time,
location, the action made, and

16
00:00:52.631 --> 00:00:57.194
the names of the users or
systems who performed the action.

17
00:00:57.194 --> 00:01:00.036
These details offer valuable insight,
not only for

18
00:01:00.036 --> 00:01:03.208
troubleshooting issues related
to system performance,

19
00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:05.949
but most importantly, for
security monitoring.

20
00:01:05.949 --> 00:01:08.424
Logs allow analysts to build a story and

21
00:01:08.424 --> 00:01:13.678
timeline around various event occurrences
to understand what exactly happened.

22
00:01:14.678 --> 00:01:16.020
This is done through log analysis.

23
00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:21.430
Log analysis is the process of examining
logs to identify events of interest.

24
00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:24.589
Since there are different
sources available to get logs,

25
00:01:24.589 --> 00:01:27.240
an enormous volume of log
data can be generated.

26
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.780
It's helpful to be selective in what
we log, so that we can log efficiently.

27
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:36.368
For example, web applications generate
a high volume of log messages, but

28
00:01:36.368 --> 00:01:39.820
not all of this data may be
relevant to an investigation.

29
00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.270
In fact, it may even slow things down.

30
00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:45.310
Excluding specific data from being logged

31
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:49.150
helps reduce the time spent
searching through log data.

32
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.150
You may recall our discussion
on SIEM technology.

33
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:55.869
SIEM tools provide security professionals
with a high-level overview

34
00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:57.480
of what happens in a network.

35
00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:01.845
SIEM tools do this by first collecting
data from multiple data sources.

36
00:02:01.845 --> 00:02:06.151
Then, the data gets aggregated or
centralized in one place.

37
00:02:06.151 --> 00:02:09.690
Finally, the diverse log
formats get normalized or

38
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:12.677
converted into a single preferred format.

39
00:02:13.677 --> 00:02:17.667
SIEM tools help process large log volumes
from multiple data sources in real-time.

40
00:02:17.667 --> 00:02:21.290
This allows security analysts to
quickly search for log data and

41
00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:24.520
perform log analysis to
support their investigations.

42
00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.383
So how do logs get collected?

43
00:02:26.383 --> 00:02:31.123
Software known as log forwarders
collect logs from various sources and

44
00:02:31.123 --> 00:02:35.954
automatically forward them to
a centralized log repository for storage.

45
00:02:36.954 --> 00:02:39.653
Since different types of devices and
systems can create logs,

46
00:02:39.653 --> 00:02:43.023
there are different log data
sources in an environment.

47
00:02:43.023 --> 00:02:47.600
These include network logs, which
are generated by devices such as proxies,

48
00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:49.888
routers, switches, and firewalls, and

49
00:02:49.888 --> 00:02:53.260
system logs, which are generated
by operating systems.

50
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:58.356
There's also application logs, which
are logs related to software applications,

51
00:02:58.356 --> 00:03:02.590
security logs, which are generated
by security tools like IDS or IPS,

52
00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:07.560
and lastly authentication logs,
which record login attempts.

53
00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:10.444
Here's an example of
a network log from a router.

54
00:03:10.444 --> 00:03:14.638
There are a couple of log entries here, but
we'll focus on the first line.

55
00:03:14.638 --> 00:03:16.970
Here, we can observe a number of fields.

56
00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.088
First, there's an action specifying
ALLOW. This means that the router's

57
00:03:22.088 --> 00:03:27.820
firewall settings allowed access from
a specific IP address to google.com.

58
00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.140
Next, there's a field specifying
the source, which lists an IP address.

59
00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:36.760
So far, the information from this log entry
is telling us that network traffic to

60
00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.910
google.com from this source
IP address is allowed.

61
00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.401
The last field specifies the timestamp,

62
00:03:42.401 --> 00:03:45.402
which is one of the most
essential fields in a log.

63
00:03:45.402 --> 00:03:49.337
We can identify the exact date and
time of an action that's occurred.

64
00:03:49.337 --> 00:03:50.338
This is useful for

65
00:03:50.338 --> 00:03:54.562
correlating multiple events to develop
a timeline of the incident.

66
00:03:54.562 --> 00:03:57.360
There you have it! You've analyzed your
first network log. Coming up,

67
00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.444
we'll continue our discussion on logs and
explore log formats.
