00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:04.550
Congratulations! You've made it
to the end of this section.

2
00:00:04.550 --> 00:00:07.700
You've made so
much progress in your security journey.

3
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.600
Let's review what we learned.

4
00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:12.670
You learned all about how to read and
analyze logs.

5
00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.680
You examined how log files are created and
used for analysis.

6
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.802
You also compared different
types of common log formats and

7
00:00:19.802 --> 00:00:21.570
learned how to read them.

8
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:25.607
You extended your understanding on
intrusion detection systems by comparing

9
00:00:25.607 --> 00:00:28.330
network-based systems and
host-based systems.

10
00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:31.000
You also learned how to
interpret signatures.

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.380
You examined how signatures are written
and also how they detect, log, and

12
00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:36.930
alert on intrusions.

13
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.598
You interacted with Suricata in the command line
to examine and interpret signatures and

14
00:00:41.598 --> 00:00:42.430
alerts.

15
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:46.740
Lastly, you learned how to search in
SIEM tools like Splunk and Chronicle.

16
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:51.323
You learned about the importance of
crafting tailored queries to locate events.

17
00:00:52.323 --> 00:00:54.448
At the forefront of incident response,
monitoring and

18
00:00:54.448 --> 00:00:59.245
analyzing network traffic for indicators
of compromise is one of the primary goals.

19
00:00:59.245 --> 00:01:03.262
Being able to perform in-depth log
analysis and knowing how to read and

20
00:01:03.262 --> 00:01:04.647
write signatures and

21
00:01:04.647 --> 00:01:08.960
how to access log data are all skills
that you'll use as a security analyst.
