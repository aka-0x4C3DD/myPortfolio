00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:05.399
Previously, you learned about signature-based
analysis. You also learned how to

2
00:00:05.399 --> 00:00:09.207
read signatures used in network-based
intrusion detection systems.

3
00:00:09.207 --> 00:00:13.763
Here, we'll use an open source signature-based
IDS called Suricata to examine

4
00:00:13.763 --> 00:00:15.310
a signature.

5
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:18.564
Many NIDS technologies come with
pre-written signatures.

6
00:00:18.564 --> 00:00:21.754
You can think of these signatures
as customizable templates.

7
00:00:21.754 --> 00:00:25.700
Sort of like different templates
available in a word processor.

8
00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.225
These signature templates provide you
with a starting point for writing and

9
00:00:29.225 --> 00:00:30.320
defining your rules.

10
00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:32.900
You can also write and add your own rules.

11
00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.162
Let's examine a pre-written
signature through Suricata.

12
00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:40.400
On this Linux machine running Ubuntu,
Suricata is already installed.

13
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.605
Let's examine some of its files by
changing directories to the etc directory

14
00:00:44.605 --> 00:00:46.930
and into the suricata directory.

15
00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.520
This is where all of Suricata's
configuration files live.

16
00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.910
Next, we'll use the ls command to list
the contents of the suricata directory.

17
00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:00.072
There's a couple of different files in
here, but we'll focus on the rules folder.

18
00:01:00.072 --> 00:01:02.800
This is where the pre-written
signatures are.

19
00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.230
You can also add custom signatures here.

20
00:01:05.230 --> 00:01:09.265
We'll use the cd command followed by
the name of the folder to navigate to that

21
00:01:09.265 --> 00:01:10.250
folder.

22
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:14.610
Using the ls command, we can observe that
the folder contains some rule templates

23
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.180
for different protocols and services.

24
00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.777
Let's examine the custom.rules
file using the less command.

25
00:01:20.777 --> 00:01:25.314
As a quick refresher, the less command
returns the content of a file

26
00:01:25.314 --> 00:01:30.360
one page at a time which makes it easy to move
forward and backward through the content.

27
00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.270
We'll use the arrow key to scroll up.

28
00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:37.533
Lines that begin with a pound sign (#)
are comments meant to provide context for

29
00:01:37.533 --> 00:01:41.190
those who read them and
are ignored by Suricata.

30
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.000
The first line says Custom rules
example for HTTP connection.

31
00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.920
This tells us that this file contains
custom rules for HTTP connections.

32
00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.270
We can observe that there's a signature.

33
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.469
The first word specifies
the signature's ACTION.

34
00:01:56.469 --> 00:01:59.350
For this signature, the action is alert.

35
00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.980
This means that the signature generates an
alert when all of the conditions are met.

36
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.990
The next part of
the signature is the HEADER.

37
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:10.134
It specifies the protocol http.
The source IP address is HOME_NET and

38
00:02:10.134 --> 00:02:12.146
source port is defined as ANY.

39
00:02:12.146 --> 00:02:17.049
The arrow indicates the direction of
traffic coming from the home network and

40
00:02:17.049 --> 00:02:22.750
going to the destination IP address
EXTERNAL_NET and ANY destination port.

41
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.215
So far, we know that this signature
triggers an alert when it detects any HTTP

42
00:02:27.215 --> 00:02:31.810
traffic leaving the home network and
going to the external network.

43
00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:35.454
Let's examine the remainder of
the signature to identify if there's any

44
00:02:35.454 --> 00:02:37.933
additional conditions
the signature looks for.

45
00:02:38.933 --> 00:02:40.950
The last part of the signature
includes the RULE OPTIONS.

46
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.490
They're enclosed in parentheses and
separated by semicolons.

47
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:49.074
There's many options listed here, but
we'll focus on the message, flow, and

48
00:02:49.074 --> 00:02:50.310
content options.

49
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.080
The message option will show the message
"GET on wire" once the alert is triggered.

50
00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.500
The flow option is used to match on
direction of network traffic flow.

51
00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.880
Here, it's established.

52
00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.170
This means that a connection
has been successfully made.

53
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:07.235
The content option inspects
the content of a packet.

54
00:03:07.235 --> 00:03:11.320
Here, between the quotation marks,
the text GET is specified.

55
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:16.180
GET is an HTTP request that's used to
retrieve and request data from a server.

56
00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.928
This means the signature will match if
a network packet contains the text GET,

57
00:03:20.928 --> 00:03:22.423
indicating a request.

58
00:03:23.423 --> 00:03:26.966
To summarize, this signature alerts
anytime Suricata observes the text GET in

59
00:03:26.966 --> 00:03:31.259
an HTTP connection from the home network,
going to the external network.

60
00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:33.917
Every environment is different and
in order for

61
00:03:33.917 --> 00:03:37.790
an IDS to be effective,
signatures must be tested and tailored.

62
00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:40.648
As a security analyst,
you may test, modify, or

63
00:03:40.648 --> 00:03:45.436
create IDS signatures to improve the
detection of threats in an environment and

64
00:03:45.436 --> 00:03:48.093
reduce the likelihood of false positives.

65
00:03:48.093 --> 00:03:51.230
Coming up,
we'll examine how Suricata logs events.

66
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:51.777
Meet you there.
