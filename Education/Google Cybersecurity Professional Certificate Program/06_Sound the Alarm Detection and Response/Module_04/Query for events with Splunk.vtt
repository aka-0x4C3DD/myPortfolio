00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.985
Now that we've reviewed
how a SIEM works,

2
00:00:02.985 --> 00:00:04.380
let's learn how to search and

3
00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.525
query events in a SIEM database.

4
00:00:06.525 --> 00:00:09.420
Data that's been imported
into a SIEM can be accessed

5
00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:12.585
by entering queries into
the SIEM's search engine.

6
00:00:12.585 --> 00:00:15.959
Massive amounts of data can
be stored in a SIEM database.

7
00:00:15.959 --> 00:00:18.690
Some of this data
may date back years.

8
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.720
This can make searching for
security events challenging.

9
00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:23.430
For example, let's say you're

10
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.695
searching to find a
failed login event.

11
00:00:25.695 --> 00:00:29.280
You search for the event using
the keywords: failed login.

12
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.380
This is a very broad query, which

13
00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:33.285
can return thousands of results.

14
00:00:33.285 --> 00:00:34.995
Broad search queries like this,

15
00:00:34.995 --> 00:00:37.500
slow down the response
times of a search engine

16
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.285
since it's searching
across all the indexed data.

17
00:00:40.285 --> 00:00:42.455
But, if you specify
additional parameters,

18
00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:45.245
like an event ID and a
date and time range,

19
00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:48.020
you can narrow down the
search to get faster results.

20
00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:49.790
It's important that
search queries

21
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:51.290
are specific, so
that you can find

22
00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.910
exactly what you're
looking for and

23
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:54.890
save time in the search process.

24
00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:58.125
Different SIEM tools use
different search methods.

25
00:00:58.125 --> 00:00:59.750
For example, Splunk uses

26
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.160
its own query language called

27
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.720
Search Processing Language,

28
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.630
or SPL for short.

29
00:01:04.630 --> 00:01:07.670
SPL has many different search
options you can use to

30
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.470
optimize search
results, so that you

31
00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.435
can get the data
you're looking for.

32
00:01:12.435 --> 00:01:12.560
For now, I'll demonstrate

33
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.200
a raw log search in Splunk
Cloud for events that

34
00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.940
reference errors or failures for

35
00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:19.925
a fictional online store
called Buttercup Games.

36
00:01:19.925 --> 00:01:22.940
First, we'll use the search
bar to type in our query:

37
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:26.750
buttercupgames error
OR fail*

38
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.000
This search is
specifying the index,

39
00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.665
which is buttercupgames.

40
00:01:30.665 --> 00:01:34.610
We also specify the search
terms: error OR fail.

41
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.770
The Boolean operator OR ensures

42
00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:39.190
that both of the keywords
will be searched.

43
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.180
The asterisk at the
end of the term

44
00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:43.505
fail* is known
as a wildcard.

45
00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:44.780
This means it will search for

46
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.570
all possible endings that
contain the term fail.

47
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.700
This helps us expand
our search results

48
00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.495
because events may label
failures differently.

49
00:01:52.495 --> 00:01:55.565
For example, some events
may use the term failed.

50
00:01:56.565 --> 00:01:57.140
Next, we'll select a time range

51
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.730
using the time range picker.

52
00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:01.820
Remember, the more specific
our search is, the better.

53
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.110
Let's search for data
from the last 30 days.

54
00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:08.475
Under the search bar, we
have our search results.

55
00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:10.205
There's a timeline,
which gives us

56
00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:11.750
a visual representation of

57
00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:13.880
the number of events
over a period.

58
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.680
This can be helpful
in identifying

59
00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:18.385
event patterns such as
peaks in activity.

60
00:02:18.385 --> 00:02:21.260
Under the timeline, there's
the events viewer, which

61
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:24.035
gives us a list of events
that match our search.

62
00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:25.865
Notice how our search terms:

63
00:02:25.865 --> 00:02:27.575
buttercupgames and error

64
00:02:27.575 --> 00:02:29.365
are highlighted in each event.

65
00:02:29.365 --> 00:02:31.205
It doesn't appear
that any events

66
00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:33.425
matching with the
term fail were found.

67
00:02:33.425 --> 00:02:36.425
Each event has a timestamp
and raw logged data.

68
00:02:36.425 --> 00:02:37.865
For the events with errors,

69
00:02:37.865 --> 00:02:39.950
it appears that there's
an error relating to

70
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:43.565
the HTTP cookies used in the
Buttercup Games website.

71
00:02:44.565 --> 00:02:45.545
At the bottom of
the raw log data,

72
00:02:45.545 --> 00:02:47.945
there's some information
related to the data source,

73
00:02:47.945 --> 00:02:49.370
including the host name,

74
00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.005
source, and source type.

75
00:02:51.005 --> 00:02:53.420
This information tells
us where the event data

76
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.215
originated from such as
a device or file.

77
00:02:56.215 --> 00:02:57.860
If we click on it,
we can choose to

78
00:02:57.860 --> 00:02:59.935
exclude it from the
search results.

79
00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:02.015
On the search bar,
we can examine

80
00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:04.025
that the search terms
have been changed

81
00:03:04.025 --> 00:03:08.555
and host!=www1
has been added,

82
00:03:08.555 --> 00:03:12.445
which means not to
include www1 hosts.

83
00:03:12.445 --> 00:03:14.870
Notice that the new
search results do not

84
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.870
contain www1 as a host,

85
00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:22.300
but contain www2 and www3.

86
00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.010
This is just one of the many
ways that you can target

87
00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.820
your searches to retrieve
information you're looking for.

88
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.410
This search is known
as a raw log search,

89
00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:33.140
which has a slower search
performance since it extracts

90
00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:36.130
log data fields during
the search process.

91
00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:37.625
As a security analyst,

92
00:03:37.625 --> 00:03:39.560
you'll use different
commands to optimize

93
00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.245
search performance for
faster search results.

94
00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:44.465
That completes
querying in Splunk.

95
00:03:44.465 --> 00:03:46.700
You've learned the importance
of effective queries

96
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.000
and how to perform a
basic Splunk search.

97
00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.830
Coming up, you'll learn how
to query events in Chronicle.
