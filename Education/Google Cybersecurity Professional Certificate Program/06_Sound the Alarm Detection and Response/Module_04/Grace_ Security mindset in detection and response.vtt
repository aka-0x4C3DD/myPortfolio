Hi, I'm Grace, and I work in Detection and
Response at Google.

3
00:00:07.729 --> 00:00:11.194
When I tell people what I do,
they think it's awesome,

4
00:00:11.194 --> 00:00:15.859
I love being able to say, my job is to
detect hackers trying to hack Google.

5
00:00:15.859 --> 00:00:21.360
There are people who trust us with their
data that play critical roles in society,

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.637
like journalists and
activists, for example.

7
00:00:24.637 --> 00:00:27.493
So they need to be able to
have their data with us and

8
00:00:27.493 --> 00:00:29.341
trust that it's going to be safe.

9
00:00:29.341 --> 00:00:33.961
Security mindset is about curiosity.

10
00:00:33.961 --> 00:00:39.441
There's a really nice overlap between
cybersecurity and computers and

11
00:00:39.441 --> 00:00:45.383
having that creative and logical outlet
and an interest in big world matters.

12
00:00:45.383 --> 00:00:47.884
What hackers are thinking,
what defenders are thinking.

13
00:00:47.884 --> 00:00:52.873
I'm empathizing with people
looking at how information can

14
00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:57.577
be attained,
perhaps sometimes from unusual sources.

15
00:00:57.577 --> 00:01:01.801
An example of one of the craziest things
that I've learned about would be how

16
00:01:01.801 --> 00:01:03.990
people can get information from a CPU.

17
00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:07.663
Some tasks for
a CPU are more difficult than others,

18
00:01:07.663 --> 00:01:12.508
require more energy to do multiplying
numbers as an example of that,

19
00:01:12.508 --> 00:01:15.765
which means that the CPU
is going to work harder,

20
00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:20.549
it's going to get hotter,
it's going to be executing more functions.

21
00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:26.888
So you can use that information to know
things about what that CPU is doing.

22
00:01:26.888 --> 00:01:31.207
From there, you can start to deduce what's
happening at a given point in time.

23
00:01:31.207 --> 00:01:35.551
What I recommend to people who
are interested in developing a security

24
00:01:35.551 --> 00:01:37.474
mindset is listen to stories.

25
00:01:37.474 --> 00:01:41.488
There are podcasts that have
great interviews with hackers.

26
00:01:41.488 --> 00:01:45.957
I recommend following the news and
reading news articles about different

27
00:01:45.957 --> 00:01:48.992
cyber threats that
are happening on in the world.

28
00:01:48.992 --> 00:01:52.109
I recommend going to conferences,
go to meetups,

29
00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:55.668
finding people that you can study with and
practice with.

30
00:01:55.668 --> 00:02:02.558
Even hackers are teaching each other how
to hack things in forums and chat rooms.

31
00:02:02.558 --> 00:02:05.544
It's not cheating to ask for help.

32
00:02:05.544 --> 00:02:07.712
Another piece of advice that I have for

33
00:02:07.712 --> 00:02:10.905
people would be to not give
up when you have roadblocks.

34
00:02:10.905 --> 00:02:13.797
Studying the certificate
is a really good idea, and

35
00:02:13.797 --> 00:02:16.830
it's really worth persevering
right to the very end.

36
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.247
Even when it gets hard and you start
feeling overwhelmed, that's okay,

37
00:02:21.247 --> 00:02:22.537
they're new terms.

38
00:02:22.537 --> 00:02:27.320
I can guarantee that if you come back
to it later, you'll be more familiar.

39
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.935
You'll find it easier.

40
00:02:28.935 --> 00:02:32.558
Being really gentle with yourself and
understanding and

41
00:02:32.558 --> 00:02:36.568
patient will help a lot when
you're facing these challenges.

42
00:02:36.568 --> 00:02:37.068
