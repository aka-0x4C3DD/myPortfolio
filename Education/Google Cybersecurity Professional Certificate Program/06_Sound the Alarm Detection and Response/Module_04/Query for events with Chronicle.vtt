1
00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.020
Chronicle allows you to
search and filter log data.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.970
In this video,
we'll explore using

3
00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.550
Chronicle's search field
to locate an event.

4
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.055
Chronicle uses the
YARA-L language

5
00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:12.915
to define rules for detection.

6
00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:14.790
It's a computer
language used to create

7
00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.135
rules for searching
through ingested log data.

8
00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:22.200
For example, you can use YARA-L
to write a rule to detect

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.970
specific activities related to

10
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.190
the exfiltration
of valuable data.

11
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:28.080
Using Chronicle's search field,

12
00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:30.959
you can search for fields
like hostname, domain,

13
00:00:30.959 --> 00:00:33.990
IP, URL, email,

14
00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.030
username, or file hash.

15
00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.550
Using the search field, you can

16
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.290
enter different
types of searches.

17
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.260
The default method of
search is using UDM search,

18
00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.720
which stands for
Unified Data Model.

19
00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.305
It searches through
normalized data.

20
00:00:48.305 --> 00:00:49.100
If you can't find the
data you're looking

21
00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.050
for searching the
normalized data,

22
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.605
you have the option of
searching raw logs.

23
00:00:53.605 --> 00:00:55.490
Raw log search searches through

24
00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:57.770
the logs which have
not been normalized.

25
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.365
From our earlier discussion
on the SIEM process,

26
00:01:00.365 --> 00:01:02.090
you may recall that raw logs get

27
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:04.475
processed during the
normalization step.

28
00:01:04.475 --> 00:01:07.220
During normalization, all
of the relevant information

29
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.665
from raw logs gets
extracted and formatted,

30
00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:11.795
making the data
easier to search.

31
00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:14.810
A reason we might need to
search raw logs is to find

32
00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.040
data that may not have been

33
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.055
included in the normalized logs,

34
00:01:18.055 --> 00:01:20.090
like specific fields
which have not been

35
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.395
normalized, or to troubleshoot
data ingestion problems.

36
00:01:24.395 --> 00:01:25.265
Let's examine a UDM search

37
00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:27.530
for a failed login
using Chronicle.

38
00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:28.790
First, let's click on

39
00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.650
the structured query
builder icon, so

40
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.990
that we can perform
a UDM search.

41
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.460
I'll type in the search:

42
00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.130
metadata.event_type = "USER_LOGIN"

43
00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:41.510
AND security_result.action
= "BLOCK"

44
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.850
Let's break down
this UDM search.

45
00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.055
Since we are searching
for normalized data,

46
00:01:46.055 --> 00:01:49.460
we need to specify a search
that uses UDM format.

47
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.600
UDM events have a set
of common fields.

48
00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.825
The metadata.event_type
field

49
00:01:54.825 --> 00:01:56.625
details the event's type.

50
00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:58.610
Here, we're asking
Chronicle to find

51
00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:01.690
an authentication activity
event, a user login.

52
00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:03.310
Next, there's AND,

53
00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:05.240
which is a logical
operator that tells

54
00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.775
the search engine to
contain both terms.

55
00:02:07.775 --> 00:02:10.460
Finally, the
security_result.action field

56
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.315
specifies a security action
such as allow or block.

57
00:02:14.315 --> 00:02:16.210
Here, the action is BLOCK.

58
00:02:16.210 --> 00:02:19.250
This means the user login
was blocked or failed.

59
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:21.995
Now, we'll press
the query button.

60
00:02:21.995 --> 00:02:25.460
We're going to focus on
searching normalized data.

61
00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:28.345
We're presented with a screen
with the search results.

62
00:02:28.345 --> 00:02:30.310
There's lots of
information here.

63
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.550
Under UDM Search,

64
00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:33.470
we can observe our search terms.

65
00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:35.629
There's also a bar
graph timeline

66
00:02:35.629 --> 00:02:38.945
visualizing the failed
login events over a period.

67
00:02:38.945 --> 00:02:40.700
At a quick glance, this gives us

68
00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:43.355
a snapshot of the failed
login activity over time,

69
00:02:43.355 --> 00:02:45.979
allowing us to spot
possible patterns.

70
00:02:45.979 --> 00:02:48.470
Under the timeline, there's
a list of events with

71
00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:51.095
timestamps associated
with this search.

72
00:02:51.095 --> 00:02:52.940
Under each event,
there's an asset,

73
00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:54.560
which is the name of a device.

74
00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:56.135
For example, this event shows

75
00:02:56.135 --> 00:02:58.690
a failed login for
a user named alice.

76
00:02:58.690 --> 00:03:00.410
If we click the
event, we can open up

77
00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:02.660
the raw log associated
with the event.

78
00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.210
We can interpret these
raw logs for more detail

79
00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:08.680
about the event's activity
during the investigation.

80
00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.345
To the left, there's
Quick Filters.

81
00:03:11.345 --> 00:03:13.220
These are additional
fields or values that

82
00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:15.425
we can use to filter
the search results.

83
00:03:15.425 --> 00:03:17.990
For example, if we
click: target.ip,

84
00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.210
we are given a list
of IP addresses.

85
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.175
If we click one of
these IP addresses,

86
00:03:22.175 --> 00:03:24.290
we can filter the search
results to contain

87
00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:26.690
only this target IP address.

88
00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:28.460
This helps us find specific data

89
00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:29.960
we're looking for and helps

90
00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.165
us save time in the
process.

91
00:03:33.165 --> 00:03:35.580
Great work! Now you know how to perform
a search using Chronicle.

92
00:03:35.580 --> 00:03:37.040
In the upcoming activity,

93
00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:38.870
you'll have the chance
to perform searches

94
00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.000
using the SIEM tools
we've just discussed.
