1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.030
Security attacks
are on the rise, and

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.859
new vulnerabilities
are exploited

3
00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:06.465
and discovered every week.

4
00:00:06.465 --> 00:00:08.520
No matter how prepared
an organization

5
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.815
may be in the event
of a security attack,

6
00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:13.020
at some point
something goes wrong.

7
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.285
Whether it's a data
breach, ransomware,

8
00:00:15.285 --> 00:00:17.505
or a simple mistake
made by an employee,

9
00:00:17.505 --> 00:00:19.980
incidents happen. And it's up to

10
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.780
security professionals
like you to

11
00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:24.585
effectively respond to
security incidents.

12
00:00:25.585 --> 00:00:26.565
Hello and welcome to the course!

13
00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:28.020
I'm Dave, and I'm a Principal

14
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:30.090
Security Strategist
for Google Cloud.

15
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.800
I have 20 years of experience

16
00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.940
as a security
practitioner and leader.

17
00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.300
Over the past eight years,

18
00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.680
I've worked at industry-leading

19
00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.465
security vendors like Fortinet,

20
00:00:38.465 --> 00:00:40.490
Splunk, and Google,
where I developed

21
00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.895
a specialty in
security analytics.

22
00:00:42.895 --> 00:00:45.230
I have a passion for
helping analysts develop

23
00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.040
the skills necessary to
succeed in their careers.

24
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:49.710
I'm so happy you're here.

25
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.470
You've done a great job so far.

26
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.915
You've learned a lot
about security concepts,

27
00:00:53.915 --> 00:00:56.915
best practices, and types
of security attacks.

28
00:00:56.915 --> 00:00:59.929
Now in this course, we'll
focus on incident detection,

29
00:00:59.929 --> 00:01:01.960
analysis, and response.

30
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:03.830
You'll have the
opportunity to apply

31
00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.620
your learning using
tools such as tcpdump,

32
00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.225
Wireshark, Suricata,
Splunk, and Chronicle.

33
00:01:10.225 --> 00:01:11.555
By the end of this course,

34
00:01:11.555 --> 00:01:13.249
you'll have an
in-depth understanding

35
00:01:13.249 --> 00:01:14.845
of incident response.

36
00:01:15.845 --> 00:01:16.220
First, you'll learn about

37
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.245
the incident response
lifecycle and how

38
00:01:18.245 --> 00:01:20.555
incident response
teams work together.

39
00:01:20.555 --> 00:01:23.210
You'll also learn about
the types of tools used in

40
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:26.110
detection and response,
including documentation.

41
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.940
You'll also be given your own
incident handler's journal

42
00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.340
that you'll use during
your investigations.

43
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.080
Next, you'll apply
your knowledge and

44
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.375
networking in Linux to
monitor and analyze

45
00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:37.340
network traffic using
packet sniffers

46
00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.440
like Wireshark and tcpdump

47
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.390
to capture and
analyze packets for

48
00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.194
potential indicators
of security incidents.

49
00:01:45.194 --> 00:01:46.970
Then, you'll become familiar
with the common processes and

50
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.210
procedures used during incident
detection and response.

51
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:52.580
You'll learn how to use
investigative tools to

52
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:56.005
analyze and verify incidents
and produce documentation.

53
00:01:57.005 --> 00:01:58.760
Finally, you'll learn how to
interpret logs and alerts.

54
00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:00.410
You'll learn how detection tools

55
00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:02.240
produce logs and how these logs

56
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:03.710
are analyzed in security

57
00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.295
information and event
management tools.

58
00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:09.850
