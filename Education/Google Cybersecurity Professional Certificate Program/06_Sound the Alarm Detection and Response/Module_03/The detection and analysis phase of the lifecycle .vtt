00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:04.902
Incidents happen, and as a security
analyst, you'll likely be tasked with

2
00:00:04.902 --> 00:00:09.640
investigating and responding to security
incidents at some point in your career.

3
00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:14.640
Let's examine the Detection and Analysis
phase of the incident response lifecycle.

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.693
This is where incident response
teams verify and analyze incidents.

5
00:00:19.693 --> 00:00:22.201
Detection enables the prompt
discovery of security events.

6
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.440
Remember not all events are incidents,
but all incidents are events.

7
00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:32.666
Events are regular occurrences in business
operations, like visits to a website or

8
00:00:32.666 --> 00:00:34.418
password reset requests.

9
00:00:34.418 --> 00:00:36.259
IDS and SIEM tools collect and

10
00:00:36.259 --> 00:00:42.330
analyze event data from different sources
to identify potential unusual activity.

11
00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:46.391
If an incident is detected, such as
a malicious actor successfully gaining

12
00:00:46.391 --> 00:00:50.270
unauthorized access to an account,
then an alert is sent out.

13
00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:53.268
Security teams then begin
the Analysis phase.

14
00:00:54.268 --> 00:00:57.650
Analysis involves the investigation and
validation of alerts.

15
00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.835
During the analysis process, analysts
must apply their critical thinking and

16
00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:05.650
incident analysis skills to
investigate and validate alerts.

17
00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:10.150
They'll examine indicators of compromise
to determine if an incident has occurred.

18
00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.361
This can be a challenge for
a couple of reasons.

19
00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.380
The challenge with detection is it's
impossible to detect everything.

20
00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.640
Even great detection tools have
limitations in how they work, and automated

21
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:27.810
tools may not be fully deployed across
an organization due to limited resources.

22
00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.292
Some incidents are unavoidable,
which is why it's important for

23
00:01:31.292 --> 00:01:34.411
organizations to have an incident
response plan in place.

24
00:01:35.411 --> 00:01:37.716
Analysts often receive a high
volume of alerts per shift,

25
00:01:37.716 --> 00:01:39.342
sometimes even thousands.

26
00:01:39.342 --> 00:01:44.180
Most of the time, high alert volumes are
caused by misconfigured alert settings.

27
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.745
For example, alert rules
that are too broad and

28
00:01:46.745 --> 00:01:51.020
not tuned to an organization's
environment create false positives.

29
00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.716
Other times, high alert volumes
can be legitimate alerts caused

30
00:01:54.716 --> 00:01:59.097
by malicious actors taking advantage
of a newly discovered vulnerability.

31
00:02:00.097 --> 00:02:03.352
As a security analyst, it's important that
you're equipped to effectively analyze

32
00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:05.578
alerts and coming up, you'll do just that.
