00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.830
That wraps up our discussion on
incident investigation and response.

2
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:07.370
Nice work on finishing up another section!

3
00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.230
We've covered a lot here, so
let's take a moment to quickly recap.

4
00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:15.623
First, we revisited the detection and
analysis phase of the NIST incident

5
00:00:15.623 --> 00:00:20.330
response lifecycle and focused on how
to investigate and verify an incident.

6
00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:23.694
We discussed the purpose of detection, and
how indicators

7
00:00:23.694 --> 00:00:28.650
of compromise can be used to identify
malicious activity on a system.

8
00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.322
Next, we examined plans and

9
00:00:30.322 --> 00:00:34.830
processes behind the incident response,
such as documentation and triage.

10
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:39.132
We also explored strategies for
containing and eradicating an incident and

11
00:00:39.132 --> 00:00:40.500
recovering from it.

12
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.030
Finally, we examined the last phase of the
incident lifecycle, post-incident actions.

13
00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:48.825
We talked about final reports,
timelines, and

14
00:00:48.825 --> 00:00:53.890
the value of scheduling post-incident
reviews through lessons learned meetings.

15
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.504
As a security analyst,
you'll be responsible for

16
00:00:56.504 --> 00:01:01.021
completing some processes involved in each
phase of the incident response lifecycle.

17
00:01:01.021 --> 00:01:03.171
Coming up, you'll learn about logs and

18
00:01:03.171 --> 00:01:05.518
have the chance to
explore them using a SIEM.
