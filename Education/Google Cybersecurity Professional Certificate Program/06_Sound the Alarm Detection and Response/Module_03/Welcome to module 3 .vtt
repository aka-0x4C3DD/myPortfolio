00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:02.100
Welcome back!

2
00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.750
I want to commend you on such
a fantastic job you're doing so far.

3
00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:09.453
The skills you are learning will create
a solid foundation as you begin your

4
00:00:09.453 --> 00:00:10.405
security career.

5
00:00:11.405 --> 00:00:13.971
In the previous section, you applied
your networking knowledge to deepen

6
00:00:13.971 --> 00:00:15.970
your understanding of network traffic.

7
00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:19.818
You practiced some skills that
security analysts use on the job like

8
00:00:19.818 --> 00:00:22.920
capturing network traffic and
dissecting packets.

9
00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.350
Next, we'll examine the life cycle of
a security incident from beginning to end.

10
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:31.172
You'll focus on how to detect,
respond, and recover from an incident.

11
00:00:32.172 --> 00:00:33.780
Coming up,
you'll learn how to investigate and

12
00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.269
verify an incident once
it's been detected.

13
00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.120
You'll explore the plans and
processes behind incident response.

14
00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.862
Finally, you'll learn about the
post-incident actions that organizations

15
00:00:43.862 --> 00:00:46.300
take to learn and
improve from the experience.

16
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:47.547
At the end of this section,

17
00:00:47.547 --> 00:00:51.080
you'll gain a comprehensive understanding
of an incident's lifecycle.

18
00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.970
You ready?

19
00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:52.731
Let's begin!
