00:00:01.047 --> 00:00:05.291
Let's continue our discussion on how
documentation provides transparency

2
00:00:05.291 --> 00:00:07.648
through documents like chain of custody.

3
00:00:07.648 --> 00:00:10.850
During incident response,
evidence must be accounted for

4
00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:13.190
during the entire incident's lifecycle.

5
00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.829
Tracking evidence is important if the
evidence is requested as part of any legal

6
00:00:17.829 --> 00:00:18.738
proceedings.

7
00:00:18.738 --> 00:00:21.625
How can security teams
ensure that this is done?

8
00:00:21.625 --> 00:00:24.146
They use a form called chain of custody.

9
00:00:25.146 --> 00:00:28.443
Chain of custody is the process of
documenting evidence possession and

10
00:00:28.443 --> 00:00:30.809
control during an incident lifecycle.

11
00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:35.301
As soon as evidence gets collected,
chain of custody forms are introduced.

12
00:00:35.301 --> 00:00:39.392
The forms should be filled out with
details as the evidence is handled.

13
00:00:40.392 --> 00:00:44.244
Let's examine a very simple example of
how chain of custody is used during

14
00:00:44.244 --> 00:00:46.208
digital forensic analysis.

15
00:00:46.208 --> 00:00:50.404
Previously, you learned that digital
forensics is the practice of collecting

16
00:00:50.404 --> 00:00:54.094
and analyzing data to determine
what has happened after an attack.

17
00:00:55.094 --> 00:00:58.624
During an incident response, Aisha
verified that a compromised hard drive

18
00:00:58.624 --> 00:01:01.481
requires examination
by the forensics team.

19
00:01:01.481 --> 00:01:05.085
First, she ensures that the hard
drive is write protected, so

20
00:01:05.085 --> 00:01:07.806
the data on the disk can't be edited or
erased.

21
00:01:07.806 --> 00:01:09.235
Then, she calculates and

22
00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:13.387
records a cryptographic hash function
of an image of the hard drive.

23
00:01:13.387 --> 00:01:17.235
Remember that a hash function is
an algorithm that produces a code that

24
00:01:17.235 --> 00:01:18.478
can't be decrypted.

25
00:01:18.478 --> 00:01:23.197
Aisha is then instructed to transfer it to
Colin in the forensics department.

26
00:01:23.197 --> 00:01:26.128
Colin examines it and
sends it off to Nav, another analyst.

27
00:01:27.128 --> 00:01:30.198
Nav receives the compromised hard drive
and sends it to her manager, Arman.

28
00:01:30.198 --> 00:01:34.395
Each time the hard drive is transferred
to another person, they need to log it in

29
00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:35.893
the chain of custody form,

30
00:01:35.893 --> 00:01:38.758
so that movement of
evidence is transparent.

31
00:01:38.758 --> 00:01:43.012
Tampering with the data on the hard drive
can be detected using the original hash

32
00:01:43.012 --> 00:01:46.011
that Aisha documented at
the beginning of the process.

33
00:01:47.011 --> 00:01:50.844
This ensures that there's a paper trail
describing who handled the evidence, and

34
00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:52.984
why, when, and where they handled it.

35
00:01:52.984 --> 00:01:54.695
Just like other documentation types,

36
00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:59.472
there is no standard template of what the
chain of custody form should look like, but

37
00:01:59.472 --> 00:02:01.490
they do contain common elements.

38
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:05.429
This is what you might examine
on a chain of custody log form.

39
00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.451
First, there should be a description of the
evidence, which includes any identifying

40
00:02:10.451 --> 00:02:14.838
information, like the location,
hostname, MAC address, or IP address.

41
00:02:15.838 --> 00:02:19.393
Next is the custody log, which details
the name of the people who transferred and

42
00:02:19.393 --> 00:02:20.851
received the evidence.

43
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:25.342
It also includes the date and time the
evidence was collected or transferred and

44
00:02:25.342 --> 00:02:27.026
the purpose of the transfer.

45
00:02:28.026 --> 00:02:31.364
You may be wondering: what happens if
evidence gets logged incorrectly?

46
00:02:31.364 --> 00:02:33.152
Or, if there's a missing entry?

47
00:02:33.152 --> 00:02:37.198
This is what's known as a broken chain
of custody, which occurs when there

48
00:02:37.198 --> 00:02:39.587
are inconsistencies in the collection and

49
00:02:39.587 --> 00:02:42.121
logging of evidence in
the chain of custody.

50
00:02:43.121 --> 00:02:45.018
In the court of law, chain
of custody documents

51
00:02:45.018 --> 00:02:50.170
help establish proof of the integrity,
reliability, and accuracy of the evidence.

52
00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:54.705
For evidence related to security incidents,
chain of custody forms are used to help

53
00:02:54.705 --> 00:02:56.030
meet legal standards

54
00:02:56.030 --> 00:03:00.220
so that this evidence can be used in
legal proceedings. If a malicious actor

55
00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.969
compromised a system, evidence must be
available to determine their actions

56
00:03:04.969 --> 00:03:08.014
so that appropriate legal
action can be taken.

57
00:03:09.014 --> 00:03:11.809
However, in some cases,
major breaks in the chain of custody can

58
00:03:11.809 --> 00:03:15.749
impact the integrity, reliability, and
accuracy of the evidence.

59
00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:20.417
This affects whether or not the evidence
can be a trusted source of information and

60
00:03:20.417 --> 00:03:21.846
used in the court of law.

61
00:03:21.846 --> 00:03:25.799
Chain of custody forms provide us with
a method of maintaining evidence, so

62
00:03:25.799 --> 00:03:29.271
that malicious actors can be held
responsible for their actions.
