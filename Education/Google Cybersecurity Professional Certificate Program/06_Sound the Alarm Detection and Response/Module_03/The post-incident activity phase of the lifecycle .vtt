00:00:00.703 --> 00:00:04.663
Now that a security team has
successfully contained eradicated and

2
00:00:04.663 --> 00:00:08.009
recovered from an incident,
their job is done, right?

3
00:00:08.009 --> 00:00:09.152
Not quite.

4
00:00:10.152 --> 00:00:11.962
Whether it's a new technology or
a new vulnerability,

5
00:00:11.962 --> 00:00:14.669
there's always more to learn
in the security field.

6
00:00:14.669 --> 00:00:18.919
The perfect time for learning and
improvement happens during the final phase

7
00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.589
of the incident response lifecycle,
post-incident activity.

8
00:00:22.589 --> 00:00:25.804
The post-incident activity
phase entails the process of

9
00:00:25.804 --> 00:00:30.535
reviewing an incident to identify areas
for improvement during incident handling.

10
00:00:31.535 --> 00:00:34.638
During this phase of the lifecycle,
different types of documentation get

11
00:00:34.638 --> 00:00:35.858
updated or created.

12
00:00:35.858 --> 00:00:40.057
One of the critical forms of documentation
that gets created is the final report.

13
00:00:40.057 --> 00:00:43.908
The final report is documentation that
provides a comprehensive review of

14
00:00:43.908 --> 00:00:44.649
an incident.

15
00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.102
It includes a timeline and details of
all events related to the incident and

16
00:00:49.102 --> 00:00:51.656
recommendations for future prevention.

17
00:00:52.656 --> 00:00:55.716
During an incident, the goal of
the security team is to focus efforts on

18
00:00:55.716 --> 00:00:57.189
response and recovery.

19
00:00:57.189 --> 00:01:02.022
After an incident, security teams work to
minimize the risk of it happening again.

20
00:01:03.022 --> 00:01:05.662
One way to improve processes is to
hold a lessons learned meeting.

21
00:01:05.662 --> 00:01:09.594
A lessons learned meeting includes all
parties involved in the incident and

22
00:01:09.594 --> 00:01:12.490
is generally held within two
weeks after the incident.

23
00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.792
During this meeting, the incident is
reviewed to determine what happened,

24
00:01:16.792 --> 00:01:20.112
what actions were taken, and
how well the actions worked.

25
00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:24.752
The final report is also used as the main
reference document during this meeting.

26
00:01:24.752 --> 00:01:29.196
The goal of the discussions in a lessons
learned meeting is to share ideas and

27
00:01:29.196 --> 00:01:33.587
information about the incident and
how to improve future response efforts.

28
00:01:34.587 --> 00:01:36.687
Here are some questions to ask
during a lessons learned meeting:

29
00:01:36.687 --> 00:01:38.338
What happened?

30
00:01:38.338 --> 00:01:40.244
What time did it happen?

31
00:01:40.244 --> 00:01:41.913
Who discovered it?

32
00:01:41.913 --> 00:01:44.603
How did it get contained?

33
00:01:44.603 --> 00:01:47.518
What were the actions taken for recovery?

34
00:01:47.518 --> 00:01:50.198
What could have been done differently?

35
00:01:51.198 --> 00:01:54.895
Incident reviews can reveal human errors
before detection and during response,

36
00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:58.905
whether it's a security analyst missing
a step in a recovery process, or

37
00:01:58.905 --> 00:02:03.450
an employee clicking a link in a phishing
email, resulting in the spread of malware.

38
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:07.379
Blaming someone for an action they did or
didn't do should be avoided.

39
00:02:07.379 --> 00:02:11.673
Instead security teams can view this as
an opportunity to learn from what happened

40
00:02:11.673 --> 00:02:12.428
and improve.
