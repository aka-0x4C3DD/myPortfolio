1
00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.340
Have you ever taken a trip to

2
00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:04.335
a place you've never
visited before?

3
00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:06.569
You may have used
a travel itinerary

4
00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.280
to plan your trip activities.

5
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:10.995
Travel itineraries are
essential documents to have,

6
00:00:10.995 --> 00:00:13.375
especially for travel
to a new place.

7
00:00:13.375 --> 00:00:15.210
They help keep you
organized and give

8
00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.110
you a clear picture
of your travel plans.

9
00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.275
They detail the
activities you'll do,

10
00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:20.670
the places you'll visit,

11
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:22.965
and your travel time
between destinations.

12
00:00:23.965 --> 00:00:25.605
Playbooks are similar
to travel itineraries.

13
00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:28.124
As you may remember from
our previous discussions,

14
00:00:28.124 --> 00:00:30.210
a playbook is a
manual that provides

15
00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.040
details about any
operational action.

16
00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.675
They provide security
analysts with instructions

17
00:00:35.675 --> 00:00:38.510
on exactly what to do
when an incident occurs.

18
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:40.730
Playbooks provide
security professionals

19
00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:41.810
with a clear picture of

20
00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:42.830
their tasks during

21
00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:45.565
the entire incident
response life cycle.

22
00:00:45.565 --> 00:00:47.480
Responding to an incident can be

23
00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:49.775
unpredictable and
chaotic at times.

24
00:00:49.775 --> 00:00:51.470
Security teams are expected to

25
00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:53.210
act quickly and effectively.

26
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:54.890
Playbooks offer structure and

27
00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:56.810
order during this
time by clearly

28
00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:58.445
outlining the actions to take

29
00:00:58.445 --> 00:01:00.605
when responding to a
specific incident.

30
00:01:00.605 --> 00:01:01.850
By following a playbook,

31
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:03.890
security teams can
reduce any guesswork

32
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:06.425
and uncertainty during
response times.

33
00:01:06.425 --> 00:01:08.300
This allows security
teams to act

34
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:10.265
quickly and without
any hesitation.

35
00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:12.860
Without playbooks, an
effective and swift response

36
00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.125
to an incident is
nearly impossible.

37
00:01:16.125 --> 00:01:17.420
Within playbooks, there
may be checklists

38
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:19.490
that can also help
security teams perform

39
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:22.460
effectively during stressful
times by helping them

40
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.110
remember to complete
each step in

41
00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.925
the incident
response life cycle.

42
00:01:26.925 --> 00:01:28.580
Playbooks outline the
steps that are necessary

43
00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:31.265
in response to an
attack like ransomware,

44
00:01:31.265 --> 00:01:34.160
data breach, malware, or DDoS.

45
00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:35.960
Here's an example
of a playbook that

46
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.535
uses a flowchart diagram

47
00:01:37.535 --> 00:01:38.930
with the steps to take during

48
00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.000
the detection of a DDoS attack.

49
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.910
This depicts the process
for detecting a DDoS

50
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.805
and begins with determining
the indicators of compromise,

51
00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:49.085
like unknown incoming traffic.

52
00:01:49.085 --> 00:01:51.935
Once the indicators of
compromise are determined,

53
00:01:51.935 --> 00:01:53.150
the next step is to collect

54
00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.820
the logs and finally
analyze the evidence.

55
00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.010
There are three different
types of playbooks:

56
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:01.280
non-automated, automated,
or semi-automated.

57
00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.560
The DDoS playbook
we just explored is

58
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.020
an example of a
non-automated playbook,

59
00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.150
which requires
step-by-step actions

60
00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.235
performed by an analyst.

61
00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:13.205
Automated playbooks
automate tasks

62
00:02:13.205 --> 00:02:16.155
in incident response
processes. For example,

63
00:02:16.155 --> 00:02:18.650
tasks such as categorizing
the severity of

64
00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.630
the incident or
gathering evidence

65
00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:23.105
can be done using an
automated playbook.

66
00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:25.100
Automated playbooks
can help lower

67
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.440
the time to resolution
during an incident.

68
00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:29.330
SOAR and SIEM tools can be

69
00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.670
configured to
automate playbooks.

70
00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:34.010
Finally, semi-automated
playbooks

71
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.980
combine a person's
action with automation.

72
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.600
Tedious, error-prone, or

73
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:40.790
time-consuming tasks
can be automated,

74
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:42.800
while analysts can prioritize

75
00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.629
their time with other tasks.

76
00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:46.715
Semi-automated
playbooks can help

77
00:02:46.715 --> 00:02:50.360
increase productivity and
decrease time to resolution.

78
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.135
As a security team
responds to incidents,

79
00:02:53.135 --> 00:02:54.650
they may discover
that a playbook

80
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:56.450
needs updates or changes.

81
00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.310
Threats are constantly evolving

82
00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.915
and for playbooks
to be effective,

83
00:02:59.915 --> 00:03:02.785
they must be maintained
and updated regularly.

84
00:03:03.785 --> 00:03:05.255
A great time to introduce
changes to playbooks

85
00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:07.985
is during the post-incident
activity phase.

86
00:03:07.985 --> 00:03:10.100
We'll be exploring more
about this phase in

87
00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:13.080
an upcoming section.
Meet you there.
