00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
As you've learned,
security analysts can be

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.375
flooded with a large amount
of alerts on any given day.

3
00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:09.315
How does an analyst manage
all of these alerts?

4
00:00:10.315 --> 00:00:11.550
Hospital emergency
departments receive

5
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:13.635
a large number of
patients every day.

6
00:00:13.635 --> 00:00:16.860
Each patient needs medical
care for a different reason,

7
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.170
but not all patients will

8
00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:20.165
receive medical
care immediately.

9
00:00:20.165 --> 00:00:21.680
This is because hospitals

10
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:23.300
have a limited
number of resources

11
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.710
available and must manage

12
00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:26.765
their time and
energy efficiently.

13
00:00:26.765 --> 00:00:30.190
They do this through a
process known as triage.

14
00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:33.050
In medicine, triage
is used to categorize

15
00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.825
patients based on the
urgency of their conditions.

16
00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:38.630
For example, patients with a
life-threatening condition

17
00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:39.980
such as a heart attack will

18
00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.010
receive immediate
medical attention,

19
00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.615
but a patient with a non-life
threatening condition like

20
00:00:44.615 --> 00:00:46.190
a broken finger may have to

21
00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.215
wait before they see a doctor.

22
00:00:48.215 --> 00:00:50.030
Triage helps to manage

23
00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.370
limited resources so
that hospital staff can

24
00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:53.660
give immediate attention to

25
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.500
patients with the most
urgent conditions.

26
00:00:57.500 --> 00:00:59.265
Triage is also used in security.

27
00:00:59.265 --> 00:01:00.970
Before an alert gets escalated,

28
00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:03.850
it goes through a triage
process, which prioritizes

29
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.440
incidents according
to their level

30
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:07.285
of importance or urgency.

31
00:01:07.285 --> 00:01:09.655
Similar to hospital
emergency departments,

32
00:01:09.655 --> 00:01:11.740
security teams have
limited resources

33
00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:14.470
available to dedicate
to incident response.

34
00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.380
Not all incidents are the same,

35
00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.920
and some may involve an
urgent response.

36
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.100
Incidents are
triaged according to

37
00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.695
the threat they pose to
the confidentiality,

38
00:01:23.695 --> 00:01:26.405
integrity, and
availability of systems.

39
00:01:27.405 --> 00:01:28.480
For example, an
incident involving

40
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.089
ransomware requires
immediate response.

41
00:01:31.089 --> 00:01:33.655
This is because ransomware
may cause financial,

42
00:01:33.655 --> 00:01:36.205
reputational, and
operational damage.

43
00:01:36.205 --> 00:01:38.320
Ransomware is a
higher priority than

44
00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:41.795
an incident like an employee
receiving a phishing email.

45
00:01:42.795 --> 00:01:44.100
When does triage happen?

46
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.630
Once an incident is
detected and an alert gets

47
00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:49.284
sent out, triage begins.

48
00:01:49.284 --> 00:01:50.680
As a security analyst,

49
00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.850
you'll identify the
different types of alerts,

50
00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:55.810
and then prioritize them
according to urgency.

51
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.200
The triage process
generally looks like this.

52
00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.820
First, you'll receive and

53
00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:02.740
assess the alert to
determine if it's a

54
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.450
false positive and whether it's

55
00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:06.460
related to an existing incident.

56
00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:07.870
If it's a true positive,

57
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:09.940
you'll assign priority
on the alert based

58
00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.535
on the organization's
policy and guidelines.

59
00:02:12.535 --> 00:02:14.410
The priority level defines how

60
00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:16.255
the organization's security team

61
00:02:16.255 --> 00:02:17.905
will respond to the incident.

62
00:02:17.905 --> 00:02:19.840
Finally, you'll
investigate the alert

63
00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.775
and collect and
analyze any evidence

64
00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:24.645
associated with the alert,
such as system logs.

65
00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.860
As an analyst, you'll want
to ensure that you complete

66
00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:29.600
a thorough analysis
so that you have

67
00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.890
enough information to make

68
00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:33.160
an informed decision
about your findings.

69
00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.180
For example, say
that you received

70
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.835
an alert for a failed
user login attempt.

71
00:02:37.835 --> 00:02:39.860
You'll need to add context to

72
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.670
your investigation to
determine if it's malicious.

73
00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:45.140
You can do so by
asking questions.

74
00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:46.400
Is there anything out of the

75
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.665
ordinary associated
with this alert?

76
00:02:48.665 --> 00:02:50.810
Are there multiple
failed login attempts?

77
00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:53.885
Did the login happen outside
of normal working hours?

78
00:02:53.885 --> 00:02:56.800
Did the login happen
outside of the network?

79
00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:59.780
These questions paint a
picture around the incident.

80
00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:01.100
By adding context,

81
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.485
you avoid making assumptions,
which can result

82
00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:06.280
in incomplete or
incorrect conclusions.

83
00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.505
Now that we've covered
how to triage alerts,

84
00:03:08.505 --> 00:03:10.340
we're ready to discuss
how to respond and

85
00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.560
recover from an
incident. Let's go!
