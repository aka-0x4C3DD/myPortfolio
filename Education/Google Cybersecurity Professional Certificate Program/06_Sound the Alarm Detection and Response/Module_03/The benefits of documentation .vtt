00:00:01.194 --> 00:00:04.945
You may recall our discussion on
the different documentation tools and types

2
00:00:04.945 --> 00:00:08.149
used by security teams
when responding to incidents.

3
00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:12.718
In this video, we'll examine the benefits
that documentation offers, so that you can

4
00:00:12.718 --> 00:00:16.980
better understand how to leverage
documentation as a security professional.

5
00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:20.948
As a security engineer who has developed
a great deal of detection rules,

6
00:00:20.948 --> 00:00:25.236
it was critical for me to document what
it means when those rules are activated,

7
00:00:25.236 --> 00:00:28.820
what severity to assign,
what might lead to false positives, and

8
00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:31.787
how the analysts can confirm
the alert is legitimate.

9
00:00:31.787 --> 00:00:33.662
Without this documentation,

10
00:00:33.662 --> 00:00:37.994
a security operations team can never
scale beyond one or two analysts.

11
00:00:38.994 --> 00:00:41.350
If something was documented,
then there's a record of it happening.

12
00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.200
This means that relevant
information can be accessed.

13
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.028
This is known as transparency.

14
00:00:46.028 --> 00:00:50.971
Transparent documentation is useful as a
source of evidence for security insurance

15
00:00:50.971 --> 00:00:54.713
claims, regulatory investigations,
and legal proceedings.

16
00:00:54.713 --> 00:00:57.855
You'll learn more about
documentation processes that

17
00:00:57.855 --> 00:01:00.402
help to achieve this in
an upcoming section.

18
00:01:01.402 --> 00:01:03.530
Documentation also
provides standardization.

19
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.630
This means that there's
an established set of guidelines or

20
00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:11.390
standards that members of an organization
can follow to complete a task or workflow.

21
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.128
An example of creating standardization
through documentation is establishing

22
00:01:16.128 --> 00:01:19.968
an organization's security
policy, processes, and procedures.

23
00:01:19.968 --> 00:01:24.592
This helps in maintaining quality of work
since there are set rules to follow.

24
00:01:25.592 --> 00:01:28.858
Documentation also improves clarity.
Effective documentation not only gives

25
00:01:28.858 --> 00:01:32.367
team members a clear understanding
of their roles and duties, but

26
00:01:32.367 --> 00:01:35.329
it also provides information
on how to get the job done.

27
00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:39.619
For example, playbooks that provide
detailed instructions prevent uncertainty

28
00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.530
and confusion during incident response.

29
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:45.886
The security field is constantly changing,
attacks evolve,

30
00:01:45.886 --> 00:01:48.360
and regulatory requirements might change.

31
00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.223
This is why it's important to maintain,
review, and

32
00:01:51.223 --> 00:01:54.530
update documentation regularly
to keep up with any changes.

33
00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.972
As a security professional, you'll likely
juggle documentation responsibilities

34
00:01:58.972 --> 00:02:00.540
alongside your other tasks.

35
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.322
By taking the time to write down your
actions, you'll recall facts and

36
00:02:04.322 --> 00:02:05.180
information.

37
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.020
You may even notice some gaps in
the previous actions you took.

38
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.300
The time you spend documenting is
valuable not only for you, but

39
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:13.951
for your entire organization.
