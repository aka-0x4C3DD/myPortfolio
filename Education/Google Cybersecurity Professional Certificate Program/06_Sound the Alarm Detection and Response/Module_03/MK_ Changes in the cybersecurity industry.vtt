00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:08.613
Hi, I'm MK, Director in the Office
of the CISO for Google Cloud.

3
00:00:08.613 --> 00:00:12.909
The role of the Chief Information Security
Officer is both to protect Google Cloud

4
00:00:12.909 --> 00:00:14.476
from a security standpoint.

5
00:00:14.476 --> 00:00:19.199
But also to ensure that we're providing
all of the tools and products necessary so

6
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:22.976
that our customers can achieve
their security outcomes as well.

7
00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:26.398
So I spent a number of years in
the US government, 32 years in fact,

8
00:00:26.398 --> 00:00:30.533
22 of which were spent as a special agent
in the Federal Bureau of Investigation.

9
00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:32.995
About midway through
the course of my career,

10
00:00:32.995 --> 00:00:37.227
I had the opportunity to shift into
cybersecurity lanes, which initiated, or

11
00:00:37.227 --> 00:00:41.857
should I say, reinitiated my interest in
all things computers and computer science.

12
00:00:41.857 --> 00:00:45.594
One of the things that the industry
lacks is a sense of agility,

13
00:00:45.594 --> 00:00:47.650
that the adversary has in spades.

14
00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:50.110
When they identify something
that works for them,

15
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:53.378
they continue to pound on it until and
unless there's an obstacle.

16
00:00:53.378 --> 00:00:55.876
And then once that obstacle
is put in their way,

17
00:00:55.876 --> 00:01:00.250
they have shown an ability to easily pivot
their tactics and techniques so that they

18
00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.270
can bypass the obstacle in future
attempts to gain access to environments.

19
00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:06.464
And so none of us can predict the future.

20
00:01:06.464 --> 00:01:08.421
We're not at any kind of final stage.

21
00:01:08.421 --> 00:01:10.893
This is a continually evolving industry.

22
00:01:10.893 --> 00:01:16.231
What you can ascertain is that we need
to be prepared in a variety of ways

23
00:01:16.231 --> 00:01:22.123
to combat what will certainly be
a persistent onslaught from the adversary.

24
00:01:22.123 --> 00:01:26.145
What that requires is
a certain sense of agility,

25
00:01:26.145 --> 00:01:30.560
you have to be comfortable
in existing in the unknown.

26
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.957
But you also have to have the intellectual
aptitude in order to be able to digest and

27
00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:36.946
formulate new solutions on the fly.

28
00:01:36.946 --> 00:01:41.430
Zero Trust is a huge trend right now
because it's both been a desire of

29
00:01:41.430 --> 00:01:44.290
the industry to move toward Zero Trust,
but

30
00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:47.632
also a requirement in some
areas around the world.

31
00:01:47.632 --> 00:01:52.549
Zero Trust is a movement away from the
historical way that we've done security in

32
00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:53.212
the past.

33
00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:56.798
Layman's terms, so
you're a business traveler, you travel

34
00:01:56.798 --> 00:02:01.468
with your business laptop and you check
into your hotel halfway around the world,

35
00:02:01.468 --> 00:02:06.288
and you need to get prepared and ready for
a business meeting that's about to occur.

36
00:02:06.288 --> 00:02:10.664
Historically, you'd want to be able
to attest to the fact that that is

37
00:02:10.664 --> 00:02:15.560
an intended or qualified user within
the enterprise attempting to gain access

38
00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.980
to this information.

39
00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:20.612
And yes, based upon the information
that you have, the identity and

40
00:02:20.612 --> 00:02:24.995
coupling that with device information,
that user and device should have access to

41
00:02:24.995 --> 00:02:28.335
this information and
be able to make a determination about it.

42
00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:32.911
I do believe that the more that we
invest in the Zero Trust approach or

43
00:02:32.911 --> 00:02:37.753
architecture, it will get us to a good
point from which to pivot off of.

44
00:02:37.753 --> 00:02:40.710
But I think a lot of what's
to come is unknown, and

45
00:02:40.710 --> 00:02:42.691
that means continual learning.

46
00:02:42.691 --> 00:02:46.899
It means, continually exposing yourself
to different parts of the industry so

47
00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:49.802
that we are prepared for
what may happen in the future.
