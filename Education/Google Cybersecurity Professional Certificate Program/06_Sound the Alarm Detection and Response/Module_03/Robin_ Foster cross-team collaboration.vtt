00:00:04.688 --> 00:00:05.513
My name is Robin,

3
00:00:05.513 --> 00:00:08.434
and I am the program management lead for
the Red Team at Google.

4
00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:11.658
I would say teamwork might be
the most important skill for

5
00:00:11.658 --> 00:00:13.680
people who work in cybersecurity.

6
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.182
The collaborative culture is to understand
that everybody brings a unique perspective

7
00:00:18.182 --> 00:00:20.506
and a useful perspective and
useful skills.

8
00:00:20.506 --> 00:00:24.412
What it is about teamwork is
that these problems are hard.

9
00:00:24.412 --> 00:00:28.796
These problems are complex.
The bad actors out there are smart,

10
00:00:28.796 --> 00:00:32.720
they're well resourced, and
they're really motivated.

11
00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.644
So they're constantly coming up with
new ways to do the activities that

12
00:00:37.644 --> 00:00:38.802
they want to do.

13
00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:41.861
It takes people with all
kinds of perspectives,

14
00:00:41.861 --> 00:00:46.861
all kinds of problem solving skills,
all kinds of knowledge to come together to

15
00:00:46.861 --> 00:00:50.985
understand what has happened,
and how we can defend against it.

16
00:00:50.985 --> 00:00:55.045
When you're working as part of a team, one
of the things to expect is that you should

17
00:00:55.045 --> 00:00:57.541
share information freely
with your colleagues and

18
00:00:57.541 --> 00:01:00.052
that they'll share
information freely with you.

19
00:01:00.052 --> 00:01:04.299
At the beginning and in the confusing
part of responding to incidents,

20
00:01:04.299 --> 00:01:06.010
all information is useful.

21
00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.254
So expect to dive right in,
share everything you know and

22
00:01:09.254 --> 00:01:11.892
listen to the things
people around you say, so

23
00:01:11.892 --> 00:01:15.350
that we come out with the best
solutions as quickly as we can.

24
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.794
Very soon after I got into
the role that I am in now,

25
00:01:18.794 --> 00:01:21.997
we experienced a very
significant incident.

26
00:01:21.997 --> 00:01:26.222
A vulnerability was discovered in
a library that was used in many,

27
00:01:26.222 --> 00:01:31.288
many different places on the Internet and
the vulnerability was significant.

28
00:01:31.288 --> 00:01:35.913
I was part of the team that came
together to respond to that, and

29
00:01:35.913 --> 00:01:41.151
that team that came together,
we set up response process that involved

30
00:01:41.151 --> 00:01:45.805
24/7 coverage using our
colleagues all around the world.

31
00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:50.763
The end result of the amazing teamwork
that we experienced was, first of all, we

32
00:01:50.763 --> 00:01:53.409
were able to manage the vulnerability.

33
00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.386
But more importantly, it's the way
the team came together afterward.

34
00:01:58.386 --> 00:02:02.809
And it's the way people still talk about
how our great team work brought us closer

35
00:02:02.809 --> 00:02:03.926
to our colleagues,

36
00:02:03.926 --> 00:02:07.320
meant that our team works better
together than it did before,

37
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.185
meant that these teamwork aspects,
they're all things that we do so well now.

38
00:02:11.185 --> 00:02:14.075
We all feel like we've been
through something together and

39
00:02:14.075 --> 00:02:16.222
that we came out stronger
on the other side.

40
00:02:16.222 --> 00:02:18.072
As you go through the certificate,

41
00:02:18.072 --> 00:02:22.138
you might learn that cybersecurity is
tricky or it's hard but don't give up.

42
00:02:22.138 --> 00:02:25.050
The more you learn,
the more you're going to enjoy it.

43
00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:28.975
So stay with it, learn everything you can,
and you're going to have a great career.
