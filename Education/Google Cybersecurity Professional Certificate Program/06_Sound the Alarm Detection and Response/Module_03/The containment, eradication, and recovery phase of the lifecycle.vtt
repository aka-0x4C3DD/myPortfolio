00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.580
In this video, we'll discuss

2
00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:05.655
the third phase of the
incident response lifecycle.

3
00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:07.620
This phase includes
the steps for

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.435
how security teams contain,

5
00:00:09.435 --> 00:00:11.895
eradicate, and recover
from an incident.

6
00:00:11.895 --> 00:00:15.254
It's important to note that
these steps interrelate.

7
00:00:15.254 --> 00:00:18.225
Containment helps meet
the goals of eradication,

8
00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:20.320
which helps meet the
goals of recovery.

9
00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:23.100
This phase of the lifecycle
also integrates with

10
00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.210
the core functions of

11
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.875
the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework, Respond and Recover.

12
00:00:27.875 --> 00:00:31.210
Let's begin with the
first step, containment.

13
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:33.320
After an incident
has been detected,

14
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.720
it must be contained.

15
00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.040
Containment is the
act of limiting and

16
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.180
preventing additional damage
caused by an incident.

17
00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.024
Organizations outline their
containment strategies

18
00:00:43.024 --> 00:00:44.950
in incident response plans.

19
00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.690
Containment strategies
detail the actions that

20
00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:49.205
security teams should take

21
00:00:49.205 --> 00:00:51.215
after an incident
has been detected.

22
00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:53.000
Different containment
strategies are

23
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.600
used for various incident types.

24
00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.250
For example, a common
containment strategy

25
00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.570
for a malware incident on

26
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:01.760
a single computer
system is to isolate

27
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.840
the affected system by
disconnecting it from the network.

28
00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.260
This prevents the spread of

29
00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.515
the malware to other
systems in the network.

30
00:01:08.515 --> 00:01:10.190
As a result, the incident is

31
00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:12.560
contained to the single
compromised system,

32
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.645
which limits any further damage.

33
00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:16.580
Containment actions
are the first step

34
00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.905
toward removing a threat
from an environment.

35
00:01:19.905 --> 00:01:20.945
Once an incident
has been contained,

36
00:01:20.945 --> 00:01:22.580
security teams work to remove

37
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.525
all traces of the incident
through eradication.

38
00:01:25.525 --> 00:01:28.190
Eradication involves
the complete removal of

39
00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.085
the incident elements from
all affected systems.

40
00:01:31.085 --> 00:01:34.640
For example, eradication
actions include performing

41
00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.470
vulnerability tests and applying

42
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.700
patches to vulnerabilities
related to the threat.

43
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.050
Finally, the last
step of this phase in

44
00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.540
the incident response
lifecycle is recovery.

45
00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:46.580
Recovery is the
process of returning

46
00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.420
affected systems back
to normal operations.

47
00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.990
An incident can disrupt

48
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.465
key business operations
and services.

49
00:01:53.465 --> 00:01:56.300
During recovery, any services
that were impacted by

50
00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:59.395
the incident are brought
back to normal operation.

51
00:01:59.395 --> 00:02:03.080
Recovery actions include:
reimaging affected systems,

52
00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.180
resetting passwords,
and adjusting

53
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:07.900
network configurations
like firewall rules.

54
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.494
Remember, the incident response
lifecycle is cyclical.

55
00:02:11.494 --> 00:02:13.490
Multiple incidents
can happen across

56
00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:15.905
time and these incidents
can be related.

57
00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:18.860
Security teams may have to
circle back to other phases

58
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.220
in the lifecycle to conduct
additional investigations.

59
00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.110
Next up, we'll discuss

60
00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:27.690
the final phase of the
lifecycle. Meet you there.
