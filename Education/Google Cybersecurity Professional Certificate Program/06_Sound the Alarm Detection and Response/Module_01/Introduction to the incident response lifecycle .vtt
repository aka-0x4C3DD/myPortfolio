00:00:01.115 --> 00:00:05.706
Incident lifecycle frameworks provide
a structure to support incident response

2
00:00:05.706 --> 00:00:06.511
operations.

3
00:00:06.511 --> 00:00:11.216
Frameworks help organizations develop
a standardized approach to their incident

4
00:00:11.216 --> 00:00:12.358
response process, so

5
00:00:12.358 --> 00:00:15.998
that incidents are managed in
an effective and consistent way.

6
00:00:15.998 --> 00:00:20.058
There are many different types of
frameworks that organizations can adopt

7
00:00:20.058 --> 00:00:22.127
and modify according to their needs.

8
00:00:23.127 --> 00:00:25.008
In this course, we'll
focus on the NIST CSF.

9
00:00:25.008 --> 00:00:27.149
Then, we'll expand on the CSF and

10
00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:31.288
discuss the phases of the NIST
incident response lifecycle.

11
00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:36.356
To recall, the five core functions
of the NIST CSF are: identify,

12
00:00:36.356 --> 00:00:39.688
protect, detect, respond, and recover.

13
00:00:39.688 --> 00:00:43.952
This course will explore the last
three steps of this framework:

14
00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:46.052
detect, respond, and recover.

15
00:00:46.052 --> 00:00:50.216
These last three steps are critical
stages during incident response, and

16
00:00:50.216 --> 00:00:53.629
as an analyst, you'll detect and
respond to incidents and

17
00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:55.619
implement actions for recovery.

18
00:00:56.619 --> 00:01:00.473
The NIST incident response lifecycle is
another NIST framework with additional substeps

19
00:01:00.473 --> 00:01:02.807
dedicated to incident response.

20
00:01:02.807 --> 00:01:07.459
It begins with preparation.
Next, detection and analysis, and

21
00:01:07.459 --> 00:01:13.640
then containment, eradication and recovery,
and finally post-incident activity.

22
00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.094
One thing to note is that the incident
lifecycle isn't a linear process.

23
00:01:18.094 --> 00:01:22.888
It's a cycle, which means that steps can
overlap as new discoveries are made.

24
00:01:23.888 --> 00:01:27.429
This lifecycle gives us a blueprint of
how to effectively respond to incidents,

25
00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:31.006
but before we dive into incident
detection and response,

26
00:01:31.006 --> 00:01:34.511
let's take some time to
understand what an incident is.

27
00:01:35.511 --> 00:01:39.321
According to NIST, an incident is
"an occurrence that actually or imminently

28
00:01:39.321 --> 00:01:44.057
jeopardizes, without lawful authority,
the confidentiality, integrity, or

29
00:01:44.057 --> 00:01:47.614
availability of information or
an information system;

30
00:01:47.614 --> 00:01:52.190
or constitutes a violation or
imminent threat of violation of law,

31
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.101
security policies, security procedures, or
acceptable use policies."

32
00:01:57.101 --> 00:01:59.168
Whoa, that's a lot to take in.

33
00:01:59.168 --> 00:02:00.574
Let's break it down.

34
00:02:01.574 --> 00:02:04.717
It's important to understand that all
security incidents are events, but

35
00:02:04.717 --> 00:02:06.998
not all events are security incidents.

36
00:02:06.998 --> 00:02:08.367
What are events?

37
00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:12.803
An event is an observable occurrence
on a network, system, or device.

38
00:02:13.803 --> 00:02:16.945
Here's an example of an event. A user
attempts to log into their email account,

39
00:02:16.945 --> 00:02:19.785
but they can't because they
forgot their password.

40
00:02:19.785 --> 00:02:25.034
The user then requests a password reset
and successfully changes their password.

41
00:02:26.034 --> 00:02:26.941
This is an observable event.

42
00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:28.005
Why?

43
00:02:28.005 --> 00:02:32.093
Because systems and applications
log password reset requests and

44
00:02:32.093 --> 00:02:35.165
logs provide evidence
that something happened.

45
00:02:35.165 --> 00:02:38.870
We know that someone successfully
requested a password reset and

46
00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.723
that they did not violate security
policies to access the account.

47
00:02:43.723 --> 00:02:46.542
Now, imagine that instead of
the rightful owner of the account,

48
00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:49.806
a malicious actor trying to
gain access to the account,

49
00:02:49.806 --> 00:02:55.031
successfully initiated the password change
request and changed the account password.

50
00:02:55.031 --> 00:02:58.848
This would be considered both an event and
a security incident.

51
00:02:58.848 --> 00:03:01.718
It's an event because it's
an observable occurrence.

52
00:03:01.718 --> 00:03:06.530
It's also a security incident because
a malicious actor violated the security

53
00:03:06.530 --> 00:03:10.850
policy to unlawfully access an account
that is not rightfully theirs.

54
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.170
Remember, all security incidents
are events, but not all events are security incidents.

55
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.094
Just like detectives
working a case carefully handle and

56
00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:21.372
document their evidence and findings,

57
00:03:21.372 --> 00:03:26.090
security analysts are required to do
the same when they investigate a security

58
00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:26.812
incident.

59
00:03:26.812 --> 00:03:31.701
An incident investigation reveals
critical information about the five W's

60
00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:32.794
of an incident:

61
00:03:32.794 --> 00:03:35.345
who triggered the incident,

62
00:03:35.345 --> 00:03:37.482
what happened,

63
00:03:37.482 --> 00:03:40.325
when the incident took place,

64
00:03:40.325 --> 00:03:45.566
where the incident took place, and
why the incident occurred.

65
00:03:46.566 --> 00:03:49.416
Keeping track of this information is
essential not only during an incident

66
00:03:49.416 --> 00:03:52.790
investigation, but also during
the closure of an investigation

67
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.322
when it comes time to write the final
report. As an analyst, you'll need a method

68
00:03:57.322 --> 00:04:01.739
to document and reference this information
for easy access when you need it.

69
00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:05.414
A great way to do this is to use
an incident handler's journal,

70
00:04:05.414 --> 00:04:09.100
which is a form of documentation
used in incident response.

71
00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:13.040
Throughout this course, you'll be using
your own incident handler's journal to take

72
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.526
notes of any incident details.

73
00:04:14.526 --> 00:04:17.821
We'll discuss more on documentation
in the upcoming lessons.
