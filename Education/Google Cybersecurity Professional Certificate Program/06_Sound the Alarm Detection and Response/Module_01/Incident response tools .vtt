00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.310
As a security analyst,

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:05.355
you'll play an important
role in incident detection.

3
00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:07.110
After all, you're going to be at

4
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.780
the front lines actively
detecting threats.

5
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.790
To do this, you'll
not only rely on

6
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:14.115
the security knowledge
you've developed so far,

7
00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:16.560
but you'll also be using
a variety of tools and

8
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:19.185
technologies to support
your investigations.

9
00:00:20.185 --> 00:00:21.270
A great carpenter
doesn't just use

10
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.370
a hammer to create a
piece of furniture.

11
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:25.140
They rely on a
variety of tools in

12
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.980
their toolbox to
get the job done.

13
00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.835
They'll need to use a tape
measure to measure dimensions,

14
00:00:29.835 --> 00:00:31.220
a saw to cut wood,

15
00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.915
and sandpaper to
smooth the surface.

16
00:00:34.915 --> 00:00:36.240
Likewise, as a security analyst,

17
00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.625
you won't be using a
single tool to monitor,

18
00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:40.545
detect, and analyze events.

19
00:00:40.545 --> 00:00:42.680
You'll use detection
and management tools

20
00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.060
to monitor system activity

21
00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.125
to identify events that
require investigation.

22
00:00:47.125 --> 00:00:49.190
You'll use documentation tools

23
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:51.140
to collect and compile evidence.

24
00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.720
And you'll also use different
investigative tools

25
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:56.675
for analyzing these events,
like packet sniffers.

26
00:00:56.675 --> 00:01:00.155
New security technologies
emerge, threats evolve,

27
00:01:00.155 --> 00:01:03.500
and attackers become
stealthier to avoid detection.

28
00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.035
To become effective
at detecting threats,

29
00:01:06.035 --> 00:01:09.710
you'll need to continuously
expand your security toolbox.

30
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.420
That's what makes
the security field

31
00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:12.995
such an exciting one to be in.

32
00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:15.230
There's always something
new to be learned.

33
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:17.750
You might remember the
incident handler's journal

34
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.150
we shared with you from
the previous section.

35
00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.610
You'll be using this
journal as your own form of

36
00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.050
documentation as you work

37
00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.660
through the rest of this course.

38
00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:26.900
Consider this to be

39
00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:30.570
your first security tool
to add to your toolbox.
