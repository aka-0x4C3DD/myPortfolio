00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:05.631
Our discussion on detection tools may have
left you wondering where alerts are sent

2
00:00:05.631 --> 00:00:08.930
and how alerts are accessed
by security analysts.

3
00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:14.010
This is where security information and
event management, or SIEM, tools are used.

4
00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:15.856
SIEM is a tool that collects and

5
00:00:15.856 --> 00:00:20.410
analyzes log data to monitor critical
activities in an organization.

6
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:24.950
SIEM provides security professionals with
a high-level overview of what goes on in

7
00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:25.980
their networks.

8
00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.540
How exactly does it do this?

9
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:30.400
Let's use an example of a car.

10
00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.286
Cars have many different parts:
tires, lights, and

11
00:00:33.286 --> 00:00:37.180
let's not forget all the internal
machinery that's under the hood.

12
00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.400
There are many different
components of a car,

13
00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.514
but how do you know if
one of them has an issue?

14
00:00:42.514 --> 00:00:45.720
Aha, you guessed it!
The dashboard warning lights.

15
00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:49.005
The dashboard notifies you
about information related to

16
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:53.523
the car's components, whether the tire
pressure or battery voltage is low,

17
00:00:53.523 --> 00:00:57.020
you need to refuel, or
a door hasn't been properly closed.

18
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.889
A car's dashboard notifies you about
the status of the car's components, so

19
00:01:00.889 --> 00:01:02.660
that you can take action to fix it.

20
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:04.700
SIEM tools work in a similar way.

21
00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:07.330
Just like cars have many
different components,

22
00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.088
a network can have thousands
of different devices and

23
00:01:10.088 --> 00:01:13.420
systems, which make monitoring
them quite the challenge.

24
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.336
A car's dashboard gives the driver a clear
picture of the status of their car, so

25
00:01:17.336 --> 00:01:21.540
they don't have to worry about
inspecting each component themselves.

26
00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:25.487
Similarly, a SIEM looks at data flows
between all the different systems in

27
00:01:25.487 --> 00:01:29.938
the network and analyzes them to provide a
real-time picture of any potential threats

28
00:01:29.938 --> 00:01:31.290
to the network.

29
00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.484
It does this by ingesting massive amounts
of data and categorizes this data, so

30
00:01:35.484 --> 00:01:39.870
that it's easily accessible through
a centralized platform similar to a car's

31
00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.180
dashboard.

32
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:43.340
Here's what the process looks like.

33
00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.950
First, SIEM tools collect and
aggregate data.

34
00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:51.046
This data is typically in the form of
logs, which are basically a record of

35
00:01:51.046 --> 00:01:53.791
all the events that
happened on a given source.

36
00:01:54.791 --> 00:01:58.789
Data can come from multiple sources
such as IDS or IPS, databases,

37
00:01:58.789 --> 00:02:02.110
firewalls, applications, and more.

38
00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.500
After all this data gets collected,
it gets aggregated.

39
00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.772
Aggregation simply means all this
data from different data sources gets

40
00:02:09.772 --> 00:02:11.710
centralized in one place.

41
00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:15.324
Depending on the number of data
sources a SIEM collects from,

42
00:02:15.324 --> 00:02:18.460
a huge volume of raw unedited
data can get collected.

43
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.821
And not all data that's collected
by a SIEM is relevant for

44
00:02:21.821 --> 00:02:24.310
security analysis purposes.

45
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.056
Next, SIEM tools normalize data.

46
00:02:27.056 --> 00:02:31.417
Normalization takes the raw data that
the SIEM has collected and cleans it up by

47
00:02:31.417 --> 00:02:35.940
removing non essential attributes so
that only what's relevant is included.

48
00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:39.504
Data normalization also creates
consistency in log records,

49
00:02:39.504 --> 00:02:41.991
which is helpful when you're searching for

50
00:02:41.991 --> 00:02:45.900
specific log information
during incident investigation.

51
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.310
Finally, the normalized data gets
analyzed according to configured rules.

52
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.985
SIEM analyzes the normalized data against
a rule set to detect any possible

53
00:02:54.985 --> 00:02:59.511
security incidents, which then get
categorized or reported as alerts for

54
00:02:59.511 --> 00:03:01.455
security analysts to review.

55
00:03:02.455 --> 00:03:05.020
Now that you've explored
the capabilities of SIEM tools,

56
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:07.570
let's examine another
security management tool.

57
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:11.031
Security orchestration,
automation, and response, or

58
00:03:11.031 --> 00:03:14.114
SOAR, is a collection of applications,
tools, and

59
00:03:14.114 --> 00:03:18.490
workflows that uses automation
to respond to security events.

60
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.750
While SIEM tools collect, analyze, and
report on security events for

61
00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:26.425
security analysts to review,
SOAR automates analysis and

62
00:03:26.425 --> 00:03:29.740
response to security events and incidents.

63
00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:32.710
SOAR can also be used to track and
manage cases.

64
00:03:32.710 --> 00:03:35.078
Multiple incidents can form a case, and

65
00:03:35.078 --> 00:03:40.310
SOAR offers a way to view all of these
incidents in one centralized place.

66
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.421
Well, there you have it. You've learned how
incident management tools like SIEM and SOAR

67
00:03:44.421 --> 00:03:48.615
make it easier for security analysts
to see what's happening in a network and

68
00:03:48.615 --> 00:03:50.698
to respond to any threats efficiently.
