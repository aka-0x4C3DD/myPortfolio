00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.045
So you've learned about incident response
teams, the different types of roles, and

2
00:00:05.045 --> 00:00:06.930
their respective responsibilities.

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:12.660
Now, let's talk about how teams respond to
incidents using incident response plans.

4
00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:17.053
When an incident occurs, incident response
teams must be prepared to respond quickly,

5
00:00:17.053 --> 00:00:19.050
efficiently, and effectively.

6
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.320
Whether it's a data breach,
DDoS attack, or ransomware,

7
00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.627
incidents have the potential to cause
significant damage to an organization.

8
00:00:26.627 --> 00:00:31.006
Like we previously mentioned, regulations
may require organizations to report

9
00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:33.180
incidents within a certain timeframe.

10
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:37.772
So it's crucial for organizations to have
a formal incident response plan in place,

11
00:00:37.772 --> 00:00:39.215
so there's a prepared and

12
00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:43.200
consistent process to quickly respond
to incidents once they occur.

13
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.844
You may remember learning that security
plans consist of three basic elements:

14
00:00:47.844 --> 00:00:51.050
policies, standards, and procedures.

15
00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.873
An incident response plan is a document
that outlines the procedures to take in

16
00:00:55.873 --> 00:00:57.928
each step of incident response.

17
00:00:58.928 --> 00:01:02.056
Response plans, just like response
teams, are not all the same.

18
00:01:02.056 --> 00:01:06.480
Organizations tailor their plans
to meet their unique requirements

19
00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.470
such as their mission, size,
culture, industry, and structure.

20
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.253
For example,

21
00:01:12.253 --> 00:01:16.498
smaller organizations may choose to
include their incident response plan in

22
00:01:16.498 --> 00:01:20.951
their security plan, while others may
choose to have them as separate documents.

23
00:01:21.951 --> 00:01:23.332
Although not all incident
plans are the same,

24
00:01:23.332 --> 00:01:25.601
there are common elements that they share.

25
00:01:26.601 --> 00:01:29.160
Incident plans have:
Incident response procedures.

26
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.183
These are step-by-step instructions
on how to respond to incidents.

27
00:01:33.183 --> 00:01:37.061
System information.
These are things like network diagrams,

28
00:01:37.061 --> 00:01:41.011
data flow diagrams, logging, and
asset inventory information.

29
00:01:41.011 --> 00:01:46.050
And other documents like contact lists,
forms, and templates.

30
00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.263
Plans aren't perfect, and
there's always room to adjust and

31
00:01:49.263 --> 00:01:51.310
improve as incidents occur.

32
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:55.900
Incident processes and procedures must
be regularly reviewed and tested.

33
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.020
This can be done through exercises
like tabletops or simulations.

34
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.173
These exercises ensure that
all team members are familiar

35
00:02:03.173 --> 00:02:04.890
with the response plan.

36
00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:09.450
They also allow organizations to identify
any missing gaps in a process to improve

37
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.820
their incident response plan.

38
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:17.050
Also, organizations may be required to
complete specific types of exercises for

39
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:19.340
regulatory reasons.

40
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.808
Coming up, we'll discuss the different
types of tools used in incident response.
