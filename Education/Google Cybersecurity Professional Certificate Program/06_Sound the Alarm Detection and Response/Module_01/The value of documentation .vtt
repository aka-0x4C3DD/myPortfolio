00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.714
Hi there.

2
00:00:01.714 --> 00:00:06.715
Previously, you learned how an incident
handler's journal is used for documenting the 5 W's of

3
00:00:06.715 --> 00:00:11.653
an incident: who, what, where,
when, and why an incident occurred.

4
00:00:11.653 --> 00:00:16.149
In this section, we'll continue our
discussion on documentation by exploring the different

5
00:00:16.149 --> 00:00:20.976
types of documentation, the importance
of effective documentation, and we'll finish off

6
00:00:20.976 --> 00:00:24.764
with the discussion on documentation tools.

7
00:00:25.764 --> 00:00:28.561
Documentation is any form of
recorded content that is used for

8
00:00:28.561 --> 00:00:30.740
a specific purpose.

9
00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.240
This can be audio, digital, or
handwritten instructions, and even videos.

10
00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:38.509
There is no set industry standard for
documentation, so

11
00:00:38.509 --> 00:00:42.100
many organizations set their
own documentation practices.

12
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.721
Regardless, documentation is
meant to provide instruction and guidance

13
00:00:45.721 --> 00:00:47.450
on a specific topic.

14
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.646
There are also many
types of documentation,

15
00:00:49.646 --> 00:00:53.660
and you may already be familiar with
some of them from the previous lessons.

16
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.374
These include playbooks, incident
handler's journals, policies, plans,

17
00:00:58.374 --> 00:00:59.790
and final reports.

18
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:04.059
Remember, there isn't an industry standard
for documentation, which means that one

19
00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:08.640
organization's documentation practices may
look completely different than another's.

20
00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:13.639
Often, organizations will tailor their
documentation practices according to their needs

21
00:01:13.639 --> 00:01:19.310
and legal requirements. They may add, remove,
or even merge documentation types.

22
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.327
Have you ever purchased a product, and
didn't know how to use it, and consulted

23
00:01:23.327 --> 00:01:27.301
the product manual for instructions on
how to do something like turn it on?

24
00:01:27.301 --> 00:01:30.778
Congrats, you've used
documentation to solve an issue.

25
00:01:31.778 --> 00:01:35.103
Previously, you've learned about how
playbooks keep business operations safe,

26
00:01:35.103 --> 00:01:39.463
and in incident response, playbooks
work similar to a product manual.

27
00:01:39.463 --> 00:01:40.464
As a refresher,

28
00:01:40.464 --> 00:01:45.080
a playbook is a manual that provides
details about any operational action.

29
00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:47.870
You'll learn more about playbooks later.

30
00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:50.280
Let's revisit that product manual example.

31
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.531
Have you ever consulted a product manual
for help and found yourself confused with

32
00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:58.030
the instructions and
unable to get the help you needed?

33
00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.437
Whether it's had to do with unclear
visuals and instructions or

34
00:02:01.437 --> 00:02:06.150
a confusing layout, you weren't able to
use the documentation to solve your issue.

35
00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.449
This is an example of
ineffective documentation.

36
00:02:10.449 --> 00:02:13.031
Effective documentation reduces
uncertainty and confusion.

37
00:02:13.031 --> 00:02:17.012
This is critical during a security
incident when tensions are high and

38
00:02:17.012 --> 00:02:18.779
urgent response is required.

39
00:02:18.779 --> 00:02:21.329
As a security professional,
you'll be using and

40
00:02:21.329 --> 00:02:23.330
creating documentation regularly.

41
00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:28.190
It's essential that the documentation you
use and produce is clear, consistent,

42
00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:32.515
and accurate, so that you and your team
can respond swiftly and decisively.

43
00:02:33.515 --> 00:02:35.151
Word processors are a common
way to document.

44
00:02:35.151 --> 00:02:42.125
Some popular tools to use are Google Docs,
OneNote, Evernote, and Notepad++.

45
00:02:43.125 --> 00:02:46.970
Ticketing systems like Jira can also be
used to document and track incidents.

46
00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.984
Lastly, Google Sheets,
audio recorders, cameras, and

47
00:02:50.984 --> 00:02:54.930
handwritten notes are also
tools you can use to document.

48
00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:57.869
Our discussion on documentation
has only just begun.

49
00:02:57.869 --> 00:03:01.444
Soon, you'll use your incident handler's
journal to put your documentation

50
00:03:01.444 --> 00:03:02.201
skills to work.
