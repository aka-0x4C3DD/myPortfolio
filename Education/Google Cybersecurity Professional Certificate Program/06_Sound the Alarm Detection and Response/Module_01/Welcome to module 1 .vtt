00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.232
Welcome. In my role as
Principal Security Strategist,

2
00:00:04.232 --> 00:00:08.313
I've seen how the incident response
operations that you'll learn about in this

3
00:00:08.313 --> 00:00:10.603
course are implemented in an organization.

4
00:00:10.603 --> 00:00:13.685
One of the things I find so
exciting about detecting and

5
00:00:13.685 --> 00:00:17.839
responding to incidents is the challenge
of using data to understand what

6
00:00:17.839 --> 00:00:21.193
an adversary has done in my
organization's environment.

7
00:00:21.193 --> 00:00:25.454
No two investigations are ever the same,
but there are patterns of behavior

8
00:00:25.454 --> 00:00:28.900
that you can learn to spot as
you hone your analytic skills.

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:32.458
Previously, you established a solid
understanding of asset security,

10
00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:34.067
threats, and vulnerabilities.

11
00:00:34.067 --> 00:00:38.802
You explored the NIST Cyber Security
Framework, or CSF, as a methodology for

12
00:00:38.802 --> 00:00:40.033
risk management.

13
00:00:40.033 --> 00:00:43.876
You learned about mitigating
organizational risk through classifying

14
00:00:43.876 --> 00:00:45.077
and securing assets.

15
00:00:45.077 --> 00:00:49.328
And you also explored security and
privacy controls to safeguard data.

16
00:00:49.328 --> 00:00:54.022
You used tools like MITRE and CVE to
investigate common vulnerabilities and

17
00:00:54.022 --> 00:00:58.657
used techniques like threat modeling
to develop an attacker's mindset.

18
00:00:59.657 --> 00:01:04.099
Next, we'll revisit the NIST CSF with a
focus on the incident response lifecycle.

19
00:01:04.099 --> 00:01:08.171
You'll be given your own incident handler's
journal, which you'll use throughout

20
00:01:08.171 --> 00:01:09.361
the rest of the course.

21
00:01:09.361 --> 00:01:12.817
You'll also be introduced to
incident response teams, including

22
00:01:12.817 --> 00:01:16.666
the different team roles and
how they organize to respond to incidents.

23
00:01:16.666 --> 00:01:20.620
And finally, you'll learn about
the different types of documentation,

24
00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:21.398
detection, and

25
00:01:21.398 --> 00:01:26.285
management tools you'll use as a security
professional working in incident response.

26
00:01:26.285 --> 00:01:29.805
Later on, you'll have
an opportunity to use these tools.

27
00:01:30.805 --> 00:01:32.833
Are you ready to begin your
journey in detection and response?

28
00:01:32.833 --> 00:01:33.983
Let's begin!
