00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:02.940
In this video, we'll
introduce you to

2
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.270
intrusion detection and
intrusion prevention systems.

3
00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.100
Imagine that you've
just installed

4
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:10.110
a home intrusion
security system.

5
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.105
You've installed
intruder sensors for

6
00:00:12.105 --> 00:00:14.310
each entry and exit
point in your home,

7
00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.500
including doors and windows.

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.510
Those sensors work
by sending out

9
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.330
sound waves, and when an
object touches a sound wave,

10
00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.560
the waves bounce back to

11
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:24.870
your sensor and trigger
an alert to your phone,

12
00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:28.005
notifying you that an
intrusion was detected.

13
00:00:29.005 --> 00:00:30.945
An intrusion detection
system, or IDS,

14
00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:34.050
works in a very similar way
to home intrusion sensors.

15
00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.880
An intrusion detection system

16
00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:37.605
is an application that monitors

17
00:00:37.605 --> 00:00:39.510
system and network activity, and

18
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.220
produces alerts on
possible intrusions.

19
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:45.260
Like the home intrusion
sensor, IDS collects and

20
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.470
analyzes system information
for abnormal activities.

21
00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.390
If something unusual
is detected,

22
00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:52.190
the IDS sends out an alert

23
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:54.685
to appropriate channels
and personnel.

24
00:00:55.685 --> 00:00:58.460
Now, imagine a jewelry
storefront with a window sensor.

25
00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.960
When the sensor detects that

26
00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.625
the window's glass
has been shattered,

27
00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:04.670
it triggers a steel roll-up
door to automatically replace

28
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.485
the shattered window and prevent

29
00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:08.870
unauthorized entry
into the store.

30
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:11.915
This is what an intrusion
prevention system does.

31
00:01:11.915 --> 00:01:14.555
Intrusion prevention
systems, or IPS,

32
00:01:14.555 --> 00:01:17.389
have all the same
capabilities as an IDS,

33
00:01:17.389 --> 00:01:18.560
but they can do more.

34
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.480
They monitor system activity for

35
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:23.680
intrusions and takes
action to stop it.

36
00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.420
Many tools have the
ability to perform

37
00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.225
the function of
both IDS and IPS.

38
00:01:29.225 --> 00:01:31.430
Some popular tools are Snort,

39
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:35.790
Zeek, Kismet, Sagan,
and Suricata.

40
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.990
We will be exploring Suricata
in upcoming lessons.

41
00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:40.205
You might be wondering,

42
00:01:40.205 --> 00:01:42.560
where do these alert
notifications go?

43
00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.065
Well, coming up, we'll
discuss how to manage alerts

44
00:01:45.065 --> 00:01:49.080
using security information
and event management tools.
