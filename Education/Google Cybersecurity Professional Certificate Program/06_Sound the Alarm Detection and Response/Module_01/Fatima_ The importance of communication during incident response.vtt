00:00:03.380 --> 00:00:05.625
My name is Fatima,

2
00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:07.110
and I'm a tech lead manager on

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:08.900
Google's Detection
and Response Team.

4
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.425
If there is a hacker
on the network,

5
00:00:10.425 --> 00:00:11.790
our job is to find them.

6
00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.770
Working in detection is

7
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:15.660
really like an artist
preparing for a show.

8
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.910
We spend all this time
developing all of

9
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.415
these signatures
to detect hackers,

10
00:00:20.415 --> 00:00:22.035
and then one day,

11
00:00:22.035 --> 00:00:23.490
it's time for the show.

12
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:25.500
You get that same nervous energy

13
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.880
and your question whether you're

14
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.470
ready for the
performance or not,

15
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:30.600
but you really don't
have a choice.

16
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.360
The hackers are
going to come and

17
00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:33.620
you have to be ready for them.

18
00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.230
I would say cybersecurity
is very exciting.

19
00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:37.940
You never know when

20
00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.450
the next vulnerability
is going to be released.

21
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.100
You never know when the next
incident is going to happen.

22
00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:46.040
A great example of
an incident would be

23
00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.725
the Log4j vulnerability
that happened in 2021.

24
00:00:48.725 --> 00:00:50.690
The entire company
came together to

25
00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:52.160
investigate whether or not we

26
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:53.990
were affected by
this vulnerability.

27
00:00:53.990 --> 00:00:57.155
It was my team's job to
make that determination.

28
00:00:57.155 --> 00:01:00.770
We ingest hundreds
of millions of lines

29
00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:02.650
of logs per second.

30
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:04.790
After we have these logs,

31
00:01:04.790 --> 00:01:07.670
it requires hunting and
log diving through them,

32
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:11.360
creating different signatures to

33
00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.250
match against these logs

34
00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.950
for signs of compromise.

35
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.290
We were able to say all clear,

36
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:21.125
we are not impacted by
this and we're safe.

37
00:01:21.125 --> 00:01:23.165
Those are the moments.
Those are the highlights.

38
00:01:23.165 --> 00:01:25.070
That's where everything
comes together.

39
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:28.990
Teamwork in an incident
response scenario, is key.

40
00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:31.985
You cannot run an
incident response

41
00:01:31.985 --> 00:01:36.500
without a really solid team,

42
00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.030
a team that works
really well together,

43
00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.750
a team that really
trust each other.

44
00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:41.030
The way to maintain

45
00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.605
clear and effective
communication

46
00:01:42.605 --> 00:01:44.390
is by communicating a lot.

47
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.000
During an incident it's a
little bit counterintuitive,

48
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.470
but the people who are the
more senior engineers,

49
00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.035
these people become
the operational leads.

50
00:01:54.035 --> 00:01:55.400
They are the people who are

51
00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:57.140
responsible for making sure that

52
00:01:57.140 --> 00:01:58.280
the communication is not

53
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.550
breaking down within
their function.

54
00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:03.020
So, we shift roles
from being very

55
00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:06.845
technical to really focusing
on the communication,

56
00:02:06.845 --> 00:02:09.170
aggregating the data,
and surfacing the data

57
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.570
to the right people who
need to know about it.

58
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.520
I definitely recommend
cybersecurity as

59
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.370
a career field because
really the attackers,

60
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:17.480
they're not going to let you get

61
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.030
bored because they
are very creative,

62
00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.600
so we have to be creative in

63
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.495
the way that we go
out looking for them.

64
00:02:22.495 --> 00:02:24.230
Being a person who
likes to learn,

65
00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:25.955
knowing that there's
always going to be

66
00:02:25.955 --> 00:02:29.215
a thing for me to learn
and become good at,

67
00:02:29.215 --> 00:02:32.580
that's exciting and that
keeps me motivated.
