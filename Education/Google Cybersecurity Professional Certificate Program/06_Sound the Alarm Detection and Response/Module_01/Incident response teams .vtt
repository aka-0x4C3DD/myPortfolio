00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:02.217
Hi again!

2
00:00:02.217 --> 00:00:06.584
In this section, we'll discuss how
incident response teams manage incidents.

3
00:00:07.584 --> 00:00:10.496
You may have been part of a team before.
Whether it was a sports team, or

4
00:00:10.496 --> 00:00:12.593
a team in the workplace or at school,

5
00:00:12.593 --> 00:00:16.720
teams are most successful when everyone
uses their diverse strengths to work

6
00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:17.997
towards a common goal.

7
00:00:18.997 --> 00:00:20.630
Incident response teams
aren't any different.

8
00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.930
A successful response to security
incidents doesn't happen in isolation.

9
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:27.249
It requires a team of both security and

10
00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:31.540
non-security professionals working
together with defined roles.

11
00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.162
Computer security incident response teams,
or CSIRTs, are a specialized group of

12
00:00:36.162 --> 00:00:41.180
security professionals that are trained
in incident management and response.

13
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.176
The goal of CSIRTs are to effectively and
efficiently manage incidents,

14
00:00:45.176 --> 00:00:48.656
provide services and resources for
response and recovery, and

15
00:00:48.656 --> 00:00:51.330
prevent future incidents from occurring.

16
00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.794
Security is a shared responsibility, which
is why CSIRTs must work cross functionally

17
00:00:55.794 --> 00:00:58.840
with other departments to
share relevant information.

18
00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.878
For example, if an incident resulted
in the breach of sensitive data,

19
00:01:02.878 --> 00:01:07.570
like financial documents or PII,
then the legal team must be consulted.

20
00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.250
Some regulatory compliance measures may
require organizations to publicly disclose

21
00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:15.350
a security incident within
a certain timeframe.

22
00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:19.862
This means that CSIRTs must collaborate
with the organization's public relations

23
00:01:19.862 --> 00:01:23.310
team to coordinate efforts for
public disclosure.

24
00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:26.042
So how exactly does a CSIRT function?

25
00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:28.400
First, there's the security analyst.

26
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.633
The analyst's job is to investigate security
alerts to determine if an incident

27
00:01:32.633 --> 00:01:33.489
has occurred.

28
00:01:33.489 --> 00:01:35.350
If an incident has been detected,

29
00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:39.260
the analyst will determine
the criticality rating of the incident.

30
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:42.884
Some incidents can be easily
remediated by the security analyst and

31
00:01:42.884 --> 00:01:44.455
don't require escalation.

32
00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:46.736
But if the incident is highly critical,

33
00:01:46.736 --> 00:01:51.231
it gets escalated to the technical lead,
who provides technical leadership by

34
00:01:51.231 --> 00:01:54.403
guiding security incidents
through their lifecycle.

35
00:01:55.403 --> 00:01:58.826
During this time, the incident coordinator
tracks and manages the activities of

36
00:01:58.826 --> 00:02:02.240
the CSIRT and other teams
involved in the response effort.

37
00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:06.277
Their job is to ensure that incident
response processes are followed and

38
00:02:06.277 --> 00:02:09.780
that teams are regularly
updated on the incident status.

39
00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.560
Not all CSIRTs are the same.

40
00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:16.779
Depending on the organization, a CSIRT
can also be referred to as an Incident

41
00:02:16.779 --> 00:02:21.820
Handling Team, or IHT, or
Security Incident Response Team, SIRT.

42
00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.208
Depending on an organization's structure,
some teams can also have a broader or

43
00:02:26.208 --> 00:02:27.420
specialized focus.

44
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:32.339
For example, some teams may be solely
dedicated to crisis management and

45
00:02:32.339 --> 00:02:35.047
others may be incorporated with a SOC.

46
00:02:35.047 --> 00:02:37.993
Roles can have different names too.
For example,

47
00:02:37.993 --> 00:02:40.814
a technical lead can also
be known as an Ops lead.

48
00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:44.718
Regardless of the team's title or
focus, they all share the same goal:

49
00:02:44.718 --> 00:02:47.560
incident management and response.

50
00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:51.766
Now that you know a bit about incident
response teams, we'll continue to learn

51
00:02:51.766 --> 00:02:56.060
about how incident response teams plan,
organize, and respond to incidents.

52
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.660
I'll meet you in the next video.
