1
00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.090
Way to go! You made it through

2
00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.385
a new section, and
you've learned a lot.

3
00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:07.320
As a refresher, we first covered

4
00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.150
the incident response
lifecycle as

5
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:12.325
a framework to support
incident response processes.

6
00:00:13.325 --> 00:00:13.910
You were also given your very

7
00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.605
own incident handler's journal

8
00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:17.570
for your incident
investigations,

9
00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.510
which you'll continue to
use throughout this course.

10
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.300
You explored how incident
response teams operate

11
00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.690
together to respond to
incidents using incident plans.

12
00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.660
You also learned about the
documentation, detection,

13
00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.824
and management tools used
during incident response.

14
00:00:33.824 --> 00:00:34.400
Congrats on making it through

15
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.845
the first part of your
incident response journey.

16
00:00:36.845 --> 00:00:39.470
Coming up, we'll explore
network monitoring.

17
00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:41.270
You'll also have
the opportunity to

18
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.355
apply your learning
through the activities.

19
00:00:43.355 --> 00:00:46.200
I'll meet you in
the next section.
