00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:05.625
My name is Dave.

2
00:00:05.625 --> 00:00:08.370
I'm a Principal Security
Strategist with Google Cloud.

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.320
My job is to work directly with

4
00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.940
security practitioners to help

5
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.980
them protect their
organizations.

6
00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:16.815
What I love about my
job is the variety.

7
00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:19.169
One day I might be
troubleshooting

8
00:00:19.169 --> 00:00:21.164
a technical problem
for a customer.

9
00:00:21.164 --> 00:00:23.055
The next day I
might be coding up

10
00:00:23.055 --> 00:00:25.350
a solution to a certain problem.

11
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.110
Every day is something new
and I never get bored.

12
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:30.630
I was a kid growing
up in the Midwest.

13
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.960
I went off to college to
study engineering, I thought.

14
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:37.350
But I realized that I wasn't
really into engineering,

15
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.240
but I loved computer science,

16
00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.920
which I didn't even
know was an option.

17
00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.980
I ended up working as

18
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.935
a help desk person
early in college,

19
00:00:45.935 --> 00:00:49.220
but then I got a job as
a system administrator.

20
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:50.615
I found myself working at

21
00:00:50.615 --> 00:00:52.985
a startup in the
payments industry.

22
00:00:52.985 --> 00:00:56.075
My job switched from
being in general

23
00:00:56.075 --> 00:00:59.990
IT person to being a
cybersecurity person.

24
00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:02.570
I spent seven years in that
job and did everything

25
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.015
from one man security shop to

26
00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:08.450
running a medium-sized security

27
00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.280
organization toward the end.

28
00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.605
Then I switched over to the
other side of the table

29
00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:15.610
and started working
for security vendors.

30
00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.330
That gave me the opportunity to

31
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.220
see how literally hundreds

32
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.565
of other organizations run
their security programs,

33
00:01:22.565 --> 00:01:25.670
and that was really eye-opening.

34
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:28.655
Cybersecurity is interesting
because you can really

35
00:01:28.655 --> 00:01:32.645
bring your entire life
experience to cybersecurity.

36
00:01:32.645 --> 00:01:36.260
What you're doing is trying
to protect an organization,

37
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.020
not necessarily like
from an accident,

38
00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.780
but you're protecting an
organization from a human

39
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:43.700
being on the other side who's

40
00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.680
trying to do your
organization harm.

41
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.420
One thing that's becoming clear

42
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.660
is that people from
diverse backgrounds and

43
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:54.575
diverse experiences
typically bring

44
00:01:54.575 --> 00:01:58.540
a great deal of improvement
to how we deal with that.

45
00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.050
I highly recommend getting

46
00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.560
involved with security
organizations.

47
00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.430
It's a place to meet
other people who

48
00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.590
can help you along
in your career.

49
00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.735
I think people are
surprised to learn

50
00:02:08.735 --> 00:02:11.725
just how much help is
available in our industry.

51
00:02:11.725 --> 00:02:14.330
There are lots of folks
who are more senior and

52
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.120
more accomplished who are
willing to be mentors.

53
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.450
I think the best thing that
you can do as someone who's

54
00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.270
looking for a mentor
is to be assertive.

55
00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:26.480
Have a plan, have

56
00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.300
a few things in mind that
you want to work on,

57
00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.940
and then reach out to
someone who maybe works in

58
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:33.260
that particular area of

59
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:35.605
cybersecurity and
ask them for help.

60
00:02:35.605 --> 00:02:37.580
I think you'll be surprised at

61
00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:41.100
just how helpful folks will be.
