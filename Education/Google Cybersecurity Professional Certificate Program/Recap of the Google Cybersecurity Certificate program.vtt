1
00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.490
This certificate covered some
rigorous security content.

2
00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:06.420
You could have given
up at any point,

3
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:08.715
but you didn't. And for that,

4
00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:10.830
you deserve to be
proud of yourself!

5
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:13.515
As we discussed at the
beginning of this program,

6
00:00:13.515 --> 00:00:15.510
the security field is growing

7
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:17.550
and in need of security
professionals,

8
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.700
just like you, to help
protect organizations

9
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.435
around the world and
the people they serve.

10
00:00:25.435 --> 00:00:27.480
The knowledge and skills
you've obtained throughout

11
00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.120
this certificate program
will allow you to begin

12
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.210
applying for entry-level
security analyst jobs.

13
00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:35.220
Now, let's take a
moment to summarize

14
00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.645
what we've discussed
throughout this program.

15
00:00:37.645 --> 00:00:41.270
We started by exploring
core security concepts,

16
00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.905
including the definition of
security and core skills.

17
00:00:45.905 --> 00:00:49.430
Then, we covered the focus of
eight security domains and

18
00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:51.305
discussed how security supports

19
00:00:51.305 --> 00:00:54.065
critical organizational
operations.

20
00:00:55.065 --> 00:00:57.605
Following that, we
discussed network security,

21
00:00:57.605 --> 00:01:00.350
including network
architecture and

22
00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.160
the mechanisms used to secure
an organization's network.

23
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.130
In the next course, we
turned our focus to

24
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.240
computing basics for
security analysts.

25
00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.255
In this section, we
introduced Linux and SQL.

26
00:01:15.255 --> 00:01:16.970
After that, we explored assets,

27
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.080
threats, and
vulnerabilities in depth.

28
00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.390
This included discussions about

29
00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.520
how assets are classified and

30
00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.250
the security controls
used by organizations

31
00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.910
to protect valuable information
and minimize risks.

32
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:33.160
In the next course, we focused

33
00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.530
on incident detection
and response.

34
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:39.190
Here, we defined what a
security incident is

35
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.380
and explained the incident
response lifecycle.

36
00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:43.960
In the following course,

37
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.490
we introduced the Python

38
00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:47.710
programming language
and explored

39
00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.070
how to develop code related
to common security tasks.

40
00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:55.330
Finally, in the last
course of the program,

41
00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:57.100
we explored topics related to

42
00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.635
your pathway into the
security profession,

43
00:01:59.635 --> 00:02:03.080
including how to find
and apply for jobs.

44
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:05.480
You put a lot of
valuable time and

45
00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:08.465
energy into completing
this certificate program.

46
00:02:08.465 --> 00:02:11.405
Remember that the learning
doesn't stop here.

47
00:02:11.405 --> 00:02:13.400
As you move forward
in your career,

48
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.960
always be mindful of

49
00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.115
the new trends developing
in the world of security.

50
00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:20.915
As technology
continues to advance,

51
00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:22.775
the threats to organizations

52
00:02:22.775 --> 00:02:25.130
and people will evolve as well.

53
00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:26.540
It's up to you to stay

54
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.120
informed and always
be willing to learn.
