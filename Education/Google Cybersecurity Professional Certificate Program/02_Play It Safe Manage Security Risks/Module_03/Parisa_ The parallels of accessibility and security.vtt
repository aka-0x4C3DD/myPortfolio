00:00:04.255 --> 00:00:07.823
My name is Parisa and I'm a vice president
of engineering and lead the Chrome Team.

3
00:00:07.823 --> 00:00:13.488
So as General manager of the Chrome Team,
I lead a team of engineers and

4
00:00:13.488 --> 00:00:18.481
product managers and
designers around the world who actually

5
00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:22.048
build Chrome and
keep all of our users safe.

6
00:00:22.048 --> 00:00:26.918
I think accessibility is important
to all aspects of technology, and

7
00:00:26.918 --> 00:00:29.476
when we think about its relevance for

8
00:00:29.476 --> 00:00:33.701
cybersecurity, you know, we ultimately
want to keep everybody safe.

9
00:00:33.701 --> 00:00:38.335
I think of accessibility as making
information, activities, or

10
00:00:38.335 --> 00:00:44.146
even environments meaningful, sensible,
usable to as many people as possible.

11
00:00:44.146 --> 00:00:48.907
And when we're talking about this in
a technology standpoint, it's usually

12
00:00:48.907 --> 00:00:53.750
about making information or services
available to people with disabilities.

13
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.522
Decisions we make based on our own
abilities to enhance security can

14
00:00:58.522 --> 00:01:00.455
actually be ineffective.

15
00:01:00.455 --> 00:01:05.687
For example, you'll sometimes
see the color red used for

16
00:01:05.687 --> 00:01:08.047
indication of a warning.

17
00:01:08.047 --> 00:01:12.582
Well, for somebody who's colorblind, like
that is going to be ineffective.

18
00:01:12.582 --> 00:01:16.890
And so really thinking about accessibility
when we're trying to keep people safe is

19
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.083
super important for them to be effective.

20
00:01:19.083 --> 00:01:21.435
I've worked in the space of security for
a really long time.

21
00:01:21.435 --> 00:01:24.144
And I do see some parallels
between the spaces.

22
00:01:24.144 --> 00:01:29.358
I've really been able to see innovation
driven when you're trying to solve

23
00:01:29.358 --> 00:01:34.338
a very specific security problem or
a specific accessibility problem.

24
00:01:34.338 --> 00:01:39.411
Closed Captioning was originally
designed and built to help people

25
00:01:39.411 --> 00:01:44.130
with hearing impairments, but
it ends up helping everybody.

26
00:01:44.130 --> 00:01:49.191
For people who are new to the field of
cybersecurity, it's just really important

27
00:01:49.191 --> 00:01:53.976
to remember that there's a range of
abilities that you are wanting to serve.

28
00:01:53.976 --> 00:01:59.318
It's so important to get user research and
feedback and a range of abilities

29
00:01:59.318 --> 00:02:04.254
in terms of testing the effectiveness
of your security mitigations.

30
00:02:04.254 --> 00:02:07.046
I know it was scary for me early on.

31
00:02:07.046 --> 00:02:09.240
I didn't look like everybody else.

32
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:13.069
I really struggled with
whether I belonged.

33
00:02:13.069 --> 00:02:17.170
Finding people who could be mentors,
having the courage to ask questions and

34
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:20.776
recognize that you're rarely
the only person with that question.

35
00:02:20.776 --> 00:02:25.482
And just sort of persevering through,
sometimes hard moments can

36
00:02:25.482 --> 00:02:29.609
lead to breakthroughs and
also just growing confidence.

37
00:02:29.609 --> 00:02:34.032
And one of the things I've
learned is me having a different

38
00:02:34.032 --> 00:02:39.097
background than other people in
this space was my own superpower.

39
00:02:39.097 --> 00:02:44.019
Instead of focusing on the delta between
what I was and what the norm was in

40
00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:48.213
the room, I should feel a lot of
pride in what made me unique and

41
00:02:48.213 --> 00:02:52.270
what unique skills and
perspective I brought to the table.
