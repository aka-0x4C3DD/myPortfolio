00:00:01.055 --> 00:00:05.095
Let's quickly review what we covered
in this section of the course.

2
00:00:05.095 --> 00:00:09.564
We started by discussing the importance
of logs and cybersecurity,

3
00:00:09.564 --> 00:00:15.880
and we explored different log types,
like firewall, network, and server logs.

4
00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:18.693
Next, we explored SIEM dashboards and

5
00:00:18.693 --> 00:00:24.236
how they use visual representations to
provide security teams with quick and

6
00:00:24.236 --> 00:00:28.771
clear insights into the security
posture of an organization.

7
00:00:29.771 --> 00:00:34.299
Finally, we introduced common SIEM
tools used in the cybersecurity

8
00:00:34.299 --> 00:00:37.719
industry, including Splunk and Chronicle.

9
00:00:38.719 --> 00:00:42.179
We'll be exploring even more security
tools later in the program, and

10
00:00:42.179 --> 00:00:45.540
you'll have opportunities
to practice using them.

11
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.948
Coming up, we'll discuss playbooks and
how they help security professionals

12
00:00:50.948 --> 00:00:56.128
respond appropriately to identify threats,
risks, and vulnerabilities.

13
00:00:56.128 --> 00:00:57.168
Meet you there.
