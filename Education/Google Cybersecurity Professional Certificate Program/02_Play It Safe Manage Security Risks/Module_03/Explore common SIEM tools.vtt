00:00:01.088 --> 00:00:02.492
Hello again!

2
00:00:02.492 --> 00:00:08.172
Previously, we discussed how SIEM tools
help security analysts monitor systems and

3
00:00:08.172 --> 00:00:10.012
detect security threats.

4
00:00:11.012 --> 00:00:15.005
In this video, we'll cover some
industry leading SIEM tools that you'll

5
00:00:15.005 --> 00:00:17.792
likely encounter as a security analyst.

6
00:00:17.792 --> 00:00:22.797
First, let's discuss the different
types of SIEM tools that

7
00:00:22.797 --> 00:00:28.486
organizations can choose from, based
on their unique security needs.

8
00:00:29.486 --> 00:00:34.489
Self-hosted SIEM tools require
organizations to install, operate, and

9
00:00:34.489 --> 00:00:41.252
maintain the tool using their own physical
infrastructure, such as server capacity.

10
00:00:41.252 --> 00:00:45.439
These applications are then managed and
maintained by

11
00:00:45.439 --> 00:00:50.635
the organization's IT department,
rather than a third party vendor.

12
00:00:50.635 --> 00:00:55.160
Self-hosted SIEM tools are ideal
when an organization is

13
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.253
required to maintain physical
control over confidential data.

14
00:01:01.253 --> 00:01:04.361
Alternatively, cloud-hosted
SIEM tools are maintained and

15
00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:09.605
managed by the SIEM providers, making
them accessible through the internet.

16
00:01:09.605 --> 00:01:14.331
Cloud-hosted SIEM tools are ideal for
organizations that don't want to

17
00:01:14.331 --> 00:01:18.459
invest in creating and
maintaining their own infrastructure.

18
00:01:19.459 --> 00:01:24.410
Or, an organization can choose to use
a combination of both self-hosted and

19
00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:28.761
cloud-hosted SIEM tools,
known as a hybrid solution.

20
00:01:28.761 --> 00:01:33.884
Organizations might choose a hybrid SIEM
solution to leverage the benefits of

21
00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:38.945
the cloud while also maintaining
physical control over confidential data.

22
00:01:39.945 --> 00:01:43.945
Splunk Enterprise, Splunk Cloud,
and Chronicle are common

23
00:01:43.945 --> 00:01:50.396
SIEM tools that many organizations use
to help protect their data and systems.

24
00:01:50.396 --> 00:01:53.420
Let's begin by discussing Splunk.

25
00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.433
Splunk is a data analysis platform and
Splunk Enterprise provides SIEM solutions.

26
00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:06.776
Splunk Enterprise is a self-hosted tool
used to retain, analyze, and search an

27
00:02:06.776 --> 00:02:13.225
organization's log data to provide security
information and alerts in real-time.

28
00:02:13.225 --> 00:02:20.467
Splunk Cloud is a cloud-hosted tool used
to collect, search, and monitor log data.

29
00:02:20.467 --> 00:02:26.428
Splunk Cloud is helpful for organizations
running hybrid or cloud-only environments,

30
00:02:26.428 --> 00:02:31.031
where some or all of the organization's
services are in the cloud.

31
00:02:32.031 --> 00:02:34.064
Finally, there's Google's Chronicle.

32
00:02:34.064 --> 00:02:40.816
Chronicle is a cloud-native tool designed
to retain, analyze, and search data.

33
00:02:40.816 --> 00:02:46.386
Chronicle provides log monitoring,
data analysis, and data collection.

34
00:02:46.386 --> 00:02:48.229
Like cloud-hosted tools,

35
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:53.524
cloud-native tools are also fully
maintained and managed by the vendor.

36
00:02:53.524 --> 00:02:58.410
But cloud-native tools
are specifically designed to take full

37
00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:03.567
advantage of cloud computing
capabilities such as availability,

38
00:03:03.567 --> 00:03:06.201
flexibility, and scalability.

39
00:03:07.201 --> 00:03:10.735
Because threat actors are frequently
improving their strategies to

40
00:03:10.735 --> 00:03:14.174
compromise the confidentiality,
integrity, and

41
00:03:14.174 --> 00:03:17.691
availability of their targets,
it's important for

42
00:03:17.691 --> 00:03:23.101
organizations to use a variety of security
tools to help defend against attacks.

43
00:03:23.101 --> 00:03:29.126
The SIEM tools we just discussed are only
a few examples of the tools available for

44
00:03:29.126 --> 00:03:33.565
security teams to use to help
defend their organizations.

45
00:03:33.565 --> 00:03:35.829
And later in the certificate program,

46
00:03:35.829 --> 00:03:40.846
you'll have the exciting opportunity to
practice using Splunk Cloud and Chronicle.
