00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.450
We've explored how
SIEM tools are used

2
00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.090
to collect and analyze log data.

3
00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.580
However, this is just one of

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.985
the many ways SIEM tools
are used in cybersecurity.

5
00:00:12.985 --> 00:00:16.140
SIEM tools can also be used
to create dashboards.

6
00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:18.479
You might have
encountered dashboards

7
00:00:18.479 --> 00:00:21.045
in an app on your
phone or other device.

8
00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:23.970
They present information
about your account or

9
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.150
location in a format
that's easy to understand.

10
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:28.545
For example,

11
00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:31.275
weather apps display
data like temperature,

12
00:00:31.275 --> 00:00:32.710
precipitation,

13
00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.425
wind speed, and the
forecast using charts,

14
00:00:36.425 --> 00:00:38.920
graphs, and other
visual elements.

15
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.600
This format makes
it easy to quickly

16
00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.375
identify weather
patterns and trends,

17
00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:47.855
so you can stay prepared and
plan your day accordingly.

18
00:00:48.855 --> 00:00:50.300
Just like weather
apps help people make

19
00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.455
quick and informed
decisions based on data,

20
00:00:53.455 --> 00:00:56.180
SIEM dashboards help
security analysts

21
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.415
quickly and easily access

22
00:00:58.415 --> 00:01:01.340
their organization's
security information as

23
00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:04.270
charts, graphs, or tables.

24
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:06.890
For example, a security analyst

25
00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:10.130
receives an alert about a
suspicious login attempt.

26
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:13.040
The analyst accesses
their SIEM dashboard

27
00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:15.680
to gather information
about this alert.

28
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.255
Using the dashboard,

29
00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:19.460
the analyst discovers
that there have been

30
00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.935
500 login attempts
for Ymara's

31
00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:24.830
account in the span
of five-minutes.

32
00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.610
They also discover that the
login attempts happened from

33
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.910
geographic locations
outside of Ymara's

34
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.035
usual location and outside
of her usual working hours.

35
00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:37.770
By using a dashboard,

36
00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:41.075
the security analyst was
able to quickly review

37
00:01:41.075 --> 00:01:43.580
visual representations
of the timeline

38
00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.155
of the login attempts,

39
00:01:45.155 --> 00:01:49.100
the location, and the exact
time of the activity,

40
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.850
then determine that the
activity was suspicious.

41
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:54.695
In addition to providing

42
00:01:54.695 --> 00:01:58.040
a comprehensive summary
of security-related data,

43
00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.500
SIEM dashboards also provide

44
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.855
stakeholders with
different metrics.

45
00:02:02.855 --> 00:02:05.990
Metrics are key
technical attributes

46
00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.610
such as response time,

47
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.355
availability, and failure rate,

48
00:02:10.355 --> 00:02:12.020
which are used to assess

49
00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.965
the performance of a
software application.

50
00:02:15.965 --> 00:02:16.760
SIEM dashboards can be

51
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.355
customized to display
specific metrics

52
00:02:19.355 --> 00:02:21.380
or other data that are relevant

53
00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:23.905
to different members
in an organization.

54
00:02:23.905 --> 00:02:28.520
For example, a security
analyst may create a dashboard

55
00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.080
that displays metrics for

56
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.930
monitoring everyday
business operations,

57
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.574
like the volume of incoming
and outgoing network traffic.

58
00:02:37.574 --> 00:02:39.520
We've examined how
security analysts use

59
00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.150
SIEM dashboards to help

60
00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:44.240
organizations maintain
their security posture.

61
00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:45.870
Well done!

62
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.310
Coming up, we'll discuss some
common SIEM tools

63
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.460
used in the cybersecurity
industry. Meet you there.
