00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.450
Welcome back!

2
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.924
Previously, we discussed security
frameworks, controls, and design

3
00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:11.850
principles, and how security professionals
apply these to security audits.

4
00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:16.067
In this section, we'll continue
to explore security tools and

5
00:00:16.067 --> 00:00:21.360
how they can help you keep organizations
and the people they serve safe.

6
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.884
Security professionals often use
a variety of tools to address

7
00:00:25.884 --> 00:00:30.833
specific security challenges,
such as collecting security data,

8
00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:35.440
detecting and analyzing threats, or
automating tasks.

9
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:41.130
Security tools help organizations achieve
a more comprehensive security posture.

10
00:00:42.130 --> 00:00:45.186
We'll begin by covering
different types of logs,

11
00:00:45.186 --> 00:00:48.320
what they track, and how they're used.

12
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:53.108
Then we'll explore security
information and event management,

13
00:00:53.108 --> 00:00:55.860
otherwise known as SIEM, dashboards.

14
00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.199
Finally, we'll discuss some common SIEM
tools used in the security industry.

15
00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.621
Let's get started!
