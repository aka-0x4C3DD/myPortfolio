00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.680
I'm Talia, and I'm an
engineer within privacy,

2
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.765
safety and security at Google.

3
00:00:09.765 --> 00:00:12.855
So there are a lot of myths in
the cybersecurity space.

4
00:00:12.855 --> 00:00:14.640
One big one is,

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:16.125
you must know how to code,

6
00:00:16.125 --> 00:00:18.135
or you must know how to hack,

7
00:00:18.135 --> 00:00:20.430
or you must be a math wiz.

8
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.480
I don't know how to code,

9
00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.585
although I have learned how
to read code over time.

10
00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:25.860
I'm not a hacker.

11
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.490
I'm not on the red
team site of security,

12
00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:31.095
I'm more on like the blue team.

13
00:00:31.095 --> 00:00:32.445
I'm not a math wiz.

14
00:00:32.445 --> 00:00:34.260
I definitely took
the business route,

15
00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:36.740
but I'm not a mathematician.

16
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.705
That wasn't really the path.

17
00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:41.420
A lot of my strength really lies

18
00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:44.405
in my ability to
build relationships,

19
00:00:44.405 --> 00:00:47.300
learn quickly on the job,

20
00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.855
doing, conducting research, asking
all the right questions.

21
00:00:50.855 --> 00:00:53.930
I think those have been
my strongest strength.

22
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:56.130
Another big myth, is that,

23
00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.955
you are required to have
a cybersecurity degree.

24
00:00:58.955 --> 00:01:03.290
I actually went to
school for business,

25
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:05.675
an advanced degree
is not required.

26
00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:07.775
Even though I did
later on go back,

27
00:01:07.775 --> 00:01:09.065
That was my preference.

28
00:01:09.065 --> 00:01:11.750
You do not need to
pursue that in order for

29
00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.325
you to be considered a great
candidate for cybersecurity.

30
00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:18.980
Another big one is you work

31
00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.560
in isolation within
cybersecurity.

32
00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.350
It really depends on the
path that you choose.

33
00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.910
But I found that to
be one of the most

34
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:29.945
that couldn't be further
from the truth.

35
00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:32.780
My biggest advice for anyone

36
00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.465
who's interested in
cybersecurity is,

37
00:01:35.465 --> 00:01:37.705
be okay with creating
your own path.

38
00:01:37.705 --> 00:01:40.140
The path looks
different for everyone.

39
00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:41.990
If you were to talk to
five different people,

40
00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:43.940
their journeys are
all different.

41
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.350
So own your journey,

42
00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.125
and identify people
who can support you.

43
00:01:48.125 --> 00:01:50.690
Let them know that you're
sitting for the certificate,

44
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:52.310
and see what support
that you can

45
00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.990
get as you start your journey.
