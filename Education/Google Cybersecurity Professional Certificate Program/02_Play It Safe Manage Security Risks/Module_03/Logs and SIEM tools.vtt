00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.955
As a security analyst,

2
00:00:02.955 --> 00:00:06.300
one of your responsibilities
might include analyzing

3
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.430
log data to mitigate and manage

4
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:11.430
threats, risks, and
vulnerabilities.

5
00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.570
As a reminder, a log is
a record of events that

6
00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:19.875
occur within an organization's
systems and networks.

7
00:00:19.875 --> 00:00:22.440
Security analysts
access a variety

8
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.615
of logs from different sources.

9
00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:28.320
Three common log sources
include firewall logs,

10
00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.350
network logs, and server logs.

11
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:35.265
Let's explore each of these
log sources in more detail.

12
00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:38.490
A firewall log is a
record of attempted or

13
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.245
established connections for

14
00:00:40.245 --> 00:00:42.635
incoming traffic
from the internet.

15
00:00:42.635 --> 00:00:45.640
It also includes
outbound requests

16
00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.065
to the internet from
within the network.

17
00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:51.280
A network log is a record of

18
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.200
all computers and devices

19
00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:55.375
that enter and
leave the network.

20
00:00:55.375 --> 00:00:58.150
It also records
connections between

21
00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:01.190
devices and services
on the network.

22
00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.960
Finally, a server
log is a record of

23
00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.870
events related to services
such as websites,

24
00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.580
emails, or file shares.

25
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.244
It includes actions
such as login,

26
00:01:14.244 --> 00:01:17.000
password, and username requests.

27
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.590
By monitoring logs, like
the one shown here,

28
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:22.764
security teams can identify

29
00:01:22.764 --> 00:01:25.810
vulnerabilities and
potential data breaches.

30
00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.255
Understanding logs is important

31
00:01:28.255 --> 00:01:29.830
because SIEM tools rely on

32
00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.620
logs to monitor systems and
detect security threats.

33
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.915
A security information and
event management, or SIEM, tool

34
00:01:37.915 --> 00:01:39.400
is an application that

35
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:42.160
collects and
analyzes log data to

36
00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.410
monitor critical activities
in an organization.

37
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:48.370
It provides real-time
visibility,

38
00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:52.615
event monitoring and analysis,
and automated alerts.

39
00:01:52.615 --> 00:01:57.115
It also stores all log data
in a centralized location.

40
00:01:58.115 --> 00:02:00.970
Because SIEM tools index and
minimize the number of logs

41
00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:02.740
a security professional must

42
00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:05.200
manually review and analyze,

43
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:08.370
they increase efficiency
and save time.

44
00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.930
But, SIEM tools must be
configured and customized to

45
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:15.910
meet each organization's
unique security needs.

46
00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:18.995
As new threats and
vulnerabilities emerge,

47
00:02:18.995 --> 00:02:21.890
organizations must
continually customize

48
00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.960
their SIEM tools to ensure that

49
00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:26.885
threats are detected
and quickly addressed.

50
00:02:27.885 --> 00:02:29.540
Later in the
certificate program,

51
00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:31.490
you'll have a chance
to practice using

52
00:02:31.490 --> 00:02:32.900
different SIEM tools to

53
00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:35.660
identify potential
security incidents.

54
00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:37.610
Coming up, we'll explore

55
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:40.310
SIEM dashboards and
how cybersecurity

56
00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:42.260
professionals use
them to monitor for

57
00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:46.050
threats, risks, and
vulnerabilities.
