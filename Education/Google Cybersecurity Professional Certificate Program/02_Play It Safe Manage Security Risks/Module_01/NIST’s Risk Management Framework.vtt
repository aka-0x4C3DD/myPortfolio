00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.840
As you might remember from
earlier in the program,

2
00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.420
the National Institute of
Standards and Technology,

3
00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.070
NIST, provides many
frameworks that are used by

4
00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:12.990
security professionals to manage

5
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.170
risks, threats, and
vulnerabilities.

6
00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:19.110
In this video, we're
going to focus on

7
00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.070
NIST's Risk Management
Framework or RMF.

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.315
As an entry-level analyst,

9
00:00:25.315 --> 00:00:27.845
you may not engage in
all of these steps,

10
00:00:27.845 --> 00:00:31.420
but it's important to be
familiar with this framework.

11
00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:34.520
Having a solid
foundational understanding

12
00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:37.250
of how to mitigate
and manage risks can

13
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:39.890
set yourself apart from
other candidates as you

14
00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.015
begin your job search in
the field of security.

15
00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:49.695
There are seven steps in the
RMF: prepare, categorize,

16
00:00:49.695 --> 00:00:58.020
select, implement, assess,
authorize, and monitor.

17
00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.260
Let's start with
Step one, prepare.

18
00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:05.450
Prepare refers to activities
that are necessary to manage

19
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.895
security and privacy risks
before a breach occurs.

20
00:01:09.895 --> 00:01:12.020
As an entry-level analyst,

21
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.410
you'll likely use this step
to monitor for risks and

22
00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:19.535
identify controls that can be
used to reduce those risks.

23
00:01:20.535 --> 00:01:22.240
Step two is categorize,

24
00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.690
which is used to develop

25
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:27.055
risk management
processes and tasks.

26
00:01:27.055 --> 00:01:31.010
Security professionals then
use those processes and

27
00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:35.045
develop tasks by thinking
about how the confidentiality,

28
00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:37.760
integrity, and availability of

29
00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.795
systems and information
can be impacted by risk.

30
00:01:41.795 --> 00:01:43.685
As an entry-level analyst,

31
00:01:43.685 --> 00:01:45.950
you'll need to be able
to understand how

32
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.320
to follow the
processes established

33
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.640
by your organization
to reduce risks to

34
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.715
critical assets, such as
private customer information.

35
00:01:56.715 --> 00:01:58.200
Step three is select.

36
00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:01.460
Select means to
choose, customize,

37
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.400
and capture documentation of

38
00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.415
the controls that
protect an organization.

39
00:02:06.415 --> 00:02:09.550
An example of the select
step would be keeping

40
00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:12.520
a playbook up-to-date
or helping to

41
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.490
manage other documentation
that allows you and

42
00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:18.995
your team to address
issues more efficiently.

43
00:02:19.995 --> 00:02:21.670
Step four is to implement

44
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:25.530
security and privacy plans
for the organization.

45
00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:29.080
Having good plans in
place is essential for

46
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.930
minimizing the impact of
ongoing security risks.

47
00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.530
For example, if you
notice a pattern of

48
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:39.905
employees constantly
needing password resets,

49
00:02:39.905 --> 00:02:41.420
implementing a change to

50
00:02:41.420 --> 00:02:44.810
password requirements may
help solve this issue.

51
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.340
Step five is assess.

52
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:49.700
Assess means to determine if

53
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:52.610
established controls are
implemented correctly.

54
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.250
An organization always wants

55
00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.130
to operate as
efficiently as possible.

56
00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.190
So it's essential to
take the time to

57
00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.980
analyze whether the
implemented protocols,

58
00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:06.590
procedures, and
controls that are in

59
00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.090
place are meeting
organizational needs.

60
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.460
During this step,
analysts identify

61
00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.099
potential weaknesses
and determine

62
00:03:16.099 --> 00:03:18.275
whether the
organization's tools,

63
00:03:18.275 --> 00:03:20.555
procedures, controls,

64
00:03:20.555 --> 00:03:22.610
and protocols should be

65
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:25.840
changed to better
manage potential risks.

66
00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.680
Step six is authorize.

67
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.850
Authorize means being
accountable for

68
00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.010
the security and
privacy risks that

69
00:03:34.010 --> 00:03:36.805
may exist in an organization.

70
00:03:36.805 --> 00:03:38.510
As an analyst,

71
00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.830
the authorization step could
involve generating reports,

72
00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:45.110
developing plans of action,

73
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.020
and establishing project
milestones that are

74
00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:51.740
aligned to your organization's
security goals.

75
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:54.560
Step seven is monitor.

76
00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.360
Monitor means to be aware of
how systems are operating.

77
00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:03.110
Assessing and maintaining
technical operations

78
00:04:03.110 --> 00:04:05.995
are tasks that analysts
complete daily.

79
00:04:05.995 --> 00:04:08.570
Part of maintaining
a low level of

80
00:04:08.570 --> 00:04:10.760
risk for an organization is

81
00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:13.070
knowing how the
current systems support

82
00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.470
the organization's
security goals.

83
00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:18.515
If the systems in place
don't meet those goals,

84
00:04:18.515 --> 00:04:20.575
changes may be needed.

85
00:04:21.575 --> 00:04:22.280
Although it may not be

86
00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.085
your job to establish
these procedures,

87
00:04:25.085 --> 00:04:27.080
you will need to make sure

88
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.330
they're working as
intended so that

89
00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:31.505
risks to the organization itself,

90
00:04:31.505 --> 00:04:35.190
and the people it
serves, are minimized.
