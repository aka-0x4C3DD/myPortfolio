00:00:00.977 --> 00:00:04.624
In this video,
we'll cover the last four domains:

2
00:00:04.624 --> 00:00:09.141
identity and access management,
security assessment and testing,

3
00:00:09.141 --> 00:00:14.252
security operations, and
software development security.

4
00:00:15.252 --> 00:00:19.138
The fifth domain is identity and
access management, or IAM.

5
00:00:19.138 --> 00:00:23.794
And it's focused on access and
authorization to keep data secure by

6
00:00:23.794 --> 00:00:29.197
making sure users follow established
policies to control and manage assets.

7
00:00:29.197 --> 00:00:35.102
As an entry-level analyst, it's essential
to keep an organization's systems and data

8
00:00:35.102 --> 00:00:40.770
as secure as possible by ensuring user
access is limited to what employees need.

9
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.147
Basically, the goal of IAM is to reduce
the overall risk to systems and data.

10
00:00:48.147 --> 00:00:52.970
For example, if everyone at a company
is using the same administrator login,

11
00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:56.776
there is no way to track who
has access to what data.

12
00:00:56.776 --> 00:00:58.563
In the event of a breach,

13
00:00:58.563 --> 00:01:04.026
separating valid user activity from
the threat actor would be impossible.

14
00:01:05.026 --> 00:01:07.291
There are four main components to IAM.

15
00:01:07.291 --> 00:01:12.516
Identification is when a user verifies
who they are by providing a user name,

16
00:01:12.516 --> 00:01:16.970
an access card, or
biometric data such as a fingerprint.

17
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:21.651
Authentication is the verification
process to prove a person's

18
00:01:21.651 --> 00:01:24.893
identity, such as entering a password or
PIN.

19
00:01:24.893 --> 00:01:29.919
Authorization takes place after a user's
identity has been confirmed and

20
00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:35.435
relates to their level of access, which
depends on the role in the organization.

21
00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:40.212
Accountability refers to monitoring and
recording user actions,

22
00:01:40.212 --> 00:01:45.002
like login attempts, to prove systems and
data are used properly.

23
00:01:46.002 --> 00:01:49.641
The sixth security domain is
security assessment and testing.

24
00:01:49.641 --> 00:01:54.158
This domain focuses on conducting
security control testing,

25
00:01:54.158 --> 00:01:59.695
collecting and analyzing data, and
conducting security audits to monitor for

26
00:01:59.695 --> 00:02:02.606
risks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

27
00:02:02.606 --> 00:02:07.258
Security control testing can help
an organization identify new and

28
00:02:07.258 --> 00:02:11.675
better ways to mitigate threats,
risks, and vulnerabilities.

29
00:02:11.675 --> 00:02:15.810
This involves examining organizational
goals and objectives, and

30
00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:20.323
evaluating if the controls being used
actually achieve those goals.

31
00:02:20.323 --> 00:02:25.412
Collecting and analyzing security data
regularly also helps prevent threats and

32
00:02:25.412 --> 00:02:27.115
risks to the organization.

33
00:02:28.115 --> 00:02:32.237
Analysts might use security control
testing evaluations and security

34
00:02:32.237 --> 00:02:37.702
assessment reports to improve existing
controls or implement new controls.

35
00:02:37.702 --> 00:02:43.252
An example of implementing a new control
could be requiring the use of multi-factor

36
00:02:43.252 --> 00:02:49.221
authentication to better protect the
organization from potential threats and risks.

37
00:02:50.221 --> 00:02:53.413
Next, let's discuss security operations.

38
00:02:53.413 --> 00:02:58.585
The security operations domain is
focused on conducting investigations and

39
00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:01.298
implementing preventative measures.

40
00:03:01.298 --> 00:03:05.843
Investigations begin once a security
incident has been identified.

41
00:03:05.843 --> 00:03:10.573
This process requires a heightened
sense of urgency in order to minimize

42
00:03:10.573 --> 00:03:13.139
potential risks to the organization.

43
00:03:13.139 --> 00:03:16.414
If there is an active attack,
mitigating the attack and

44
00:03:16.414 --> 00:03:19.831
preventing it from escalating further
is essential for

45
00:03:19.831 --> 00:03:23.963
ensuring that private information
is protected from threat actors.

46
00:03:24.963 --> 00:03:28.398
Once the threat has been neutralized,
the collection of digital and physical

47
00:03:28.398 --> 00:03:32.845
evidence to conduct
a forensic investigation will begin.

48
00:03:32.845 --> 00:03:37.259
A digital forensic investigation
must take place to identify

49
00:03:37.259 --> 00:03:41.279
when, how, and
why the breach occurred.

50
00:03:41.279 --> 00:03:45.360
This helps security teams determine
areas for improvement and

51
00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.904
preventative measures that can be
taken to mitigate future attacks.

52
00:03:50.904 --> 00:03:54.988
The eighth and final security domain
is software development security.

53
00:03:54.988 --> 00:03:59.259
This domain focuses on using
secure coding practices.

54
00:03:59.259 --> 00:04:03.877
As you may remember,
secure coding practices are recommended guidelines

55
00:04:03.877 --> 00:04:09.116
that are used to create
secure applications and services.

56
00:04:09.116 --> 00:04:13.834
The software development lifecycle is
an efficient process used by teams to

57
00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:16.866
quickly build software products and
features.

58
00:04:16.866 --> 00:04:21.167
In this process, security
is an additional step.

59
00:04:21.167 --> 00:04:25.942
By ensuring that each phase of the
software development lifecycle undergoes

60
00:04:25.942 --> 00:04:31.017
security reviews, security can be fully
integrated into the software product.

61
00:04:32.017 --> 00:04:35.699
For example, performing a secure
design review during the design phase,

62
00:04:35.699 --> 00:04:39.798
secure code reviews during
the development and testing phases,

63
00:04:39.798 --> 00:04:44.944
and penetration testing during
the deployment and implementation phase

64
00:04:44.944 --> 00:04:50.263
ensures that security is embedded into
the software product at every step.

65
00:04:50.263 --> 00:04:54.649
This keeps software secure and
sensitive data protected, and

66
00:04:54.649 --> 00:04:58.268
mitigates unnecessary
risk to an organization.

67
00:04:59.268 --> 00:05:03.218
Being familiar with these domains can
help you better understand how they're

68
00:05:03.218 --> 00:05:06.968
used to improve the overall
security of an organization and

69
00:05:06.968 --> 00:05:09.530
the critical role security teams play.

70
00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:14.044
Next, we'll discuss security threats,
risks, and vulnerabilities,

71
00:05:14.044 --> 00:05:18.643
including ransomware, and introduce
you to the three layers of the web.
