00:00:01.068 --> 00:00:05.995
As an entry-level security analyst,
one of your many roles will be to handle

2
00:00:05.995 --> 00:00:09.374
an organization's digital and
physical assets.

3
00:00:09.374 --> 00:00:10.513
As a reminder,

4
00:00:10.513 --> 00:00:15.341
an asset is an item perceived as
having value to an organization.

5
00:00:15.341 --> 00:00:20.634
During their lifespan, organizations
acquire all types of assets, including

6
00:00:20.634 --> 00:00:26.167
physical office spaces, computers,
customers' PII, intellectual property,

7
00:00:26.167 --> 00:00:30.358
such as patents or copyrighted
data, and so much more.

8
00:00:30.358 --> 00:00:35.020
Unfortunately, organizations operate
in an environment that presents

9
00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:39.916
multiple security threats, risks,
and vulnerabilities to their assets.

10
00:00:39.916 --> 00:00:44.264
Let's review what threats, risks,
and vulnerabilities are and

11
00:00:44.264 --> 00:00:46.834
discuss some common examples of each.

12
00:00:47.834 --> 00:00:52.722
A threat is any circumstance or
event that can negatively impact assets.

13
00:00:52.722 --> 00:00:56.289
One example of a threat is
a social engineering attack.

14
00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:00.991
Social engineering is a manipulation
technique that exploits human error

15
00:01:00.991 --> 00:01:05.215
to gain private information,
access, or valuables.

16
00:01:05.215 --> 00:01:10.103
Malicious links in email messages that
look like they're from legitimate companies

17
00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:15.081
or people is one method of
social engineering known as phishing.

18
00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:19.904
As a reminder, phishing is a technique
that is used to acquire sensitive data,

19
00:01:19.904 --> 00:01:23.629
such as user names, passwords,
or banking information.

20
00:01:24.629 --> 00:01:26.068
Risks are different from threats.

21
00:01:26.068 --> 00:01:31.044
A risk is anything that can impact
the confidentiality, integrity,

22
00:01:31.044 --> 00:01:33.165
or availability of an asset.

23
00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:36.248
Think of a risk as the likelihood
of a threat occurring.

24
00:01:36.248 --> 00:01:41.614
An example of a risk to an organization
might be the lack of backup protocols for

25
00:01:41.614 --> 00:01:47.144
making sure its stored information can be
recovered in the event of an accident or

26
00:01:47.144 --> 00:01:48.632
security incident.

27
00:01:48.632 --> 00:01:53.943
Organizations tend to rate risks
at different levels: low, medium,

28
00:01:53.943 --> 00:01:58.999
and high, depending on possible
threats and the value of an asset.

29
00:01:59.999 --> 00:02:04.702
A low-risk asset is information that would
not harm the organization's reputation or

30
00:02:04.702 --> 00:02:09.726
ongoing operations, and would not
cause financial damage if compromised.

31
00:02:09.726 --> 00:02:14.118
This includes public information
such as website content, or

32
00:02:14.118 --> 00:02:16.105
published research data.

33
00:02:17.105 --> 00:02:20.810
A medium-risk asset might include
information that's not available

34
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.666
to the public and may cause some
damage to the organization's finances,

35
00:02:25.666 --> 00:02:28.267
reputation, or ongoing operations.

36
00:02:28.267 --> 00:02:33.132
For example, the early release of a
company's quarterly earnings could impact

37
00:02:33.132 --> 00:02:34.716
the value of their stock.

38
00:02:35.716 --> 00:02:39.676
A high-risk asset is any information
protected by regulations or laws,

39
00:02:39.676 --> 00:02:43.676
which if compromised, would have
a severe negative impact on

40
00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:48.477
an organization's finances,
ongoing operations, or reputation.

41
00:02:48.477 --> 00:02:53.395
This could include leaked assets with SPII,
PII,

42
00:02:53.395 --> 00:02:56.215
or intellectual property.

43
00:02:57.215 --> 00:03:00.167
Now, let's discuss vulnerabilities.

44
00:03:00.167 --> 00:03:04.258
A vulnerability is a weakness that
can be exploited by a threat.

45
00:03:04.258 --> 00:03:08.356
And it's worth noting that
both a vulnerability and

46
00:03:08.356 --> 00:03:11.904
threat must be present for
there to be a risk.

47
00:03:11.904 --> 00:03:16.838
Examples of vulnerabilities include:
an outdated firewall, software, or

48
00:03:16.838 --> 00:03:21.699
application; weak passwords; or
unprotected confidential data.

49
00:03:21.699 --> 00:03:25.337
People can also be
considered a vulnerability.

50
00:03:25.337 --> 00:03:31.258
People's actions can significantly affect
an organization's internal network.

51
00:03:31.258 --> 00:03:35.299
Whether it's a client,
external vendor, or employee,

52
00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.419
maintaining security
must be a united effort.

53
00:03:40.419 --> 00:03:42.342
So entry-level analysts
need to educate and

54
00:03:42.342 --> 00:03:45.599
empower people to be
more security conscious.

55
00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:51.995
For example, educating people on how to identify a
phishing email is a great starting point.

56
00:03:51.995 --> 00:03:56.698
Using access cards to grant employee
access to physical spaces while

57
00:03:56.698 --> 00:04:01.249
restricting outside visitors is
another good security measure.

58
00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:05.766
Organizations must continually
improve their efforts when it comes to

59
00:04:05.766 --> 00:04:10.748
identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities
to minimize threats and risks.

60
00:04:10.748 --> 00:04:15.565
Entry-level analysts can support this
goal by encouraging employees to

61
00:04:15.565 --> 00:04:19.421
report suspicious activity and
actively monitoring and

62
00:04:19.421 --> 00:04:22.965
documenting employees'
access to critical assets.

63
00:04:23.965 --> 00:04:26.609
Now that you're familiar with
some of the threats, risks, and

64
00:04:26.609 --> 00:04:29.587
vulnerabilities analysts
frequently encounter,

65
00:04:29.587 --> 00:04:33.647
coming up, we'll discuss how
they impact business operations.
