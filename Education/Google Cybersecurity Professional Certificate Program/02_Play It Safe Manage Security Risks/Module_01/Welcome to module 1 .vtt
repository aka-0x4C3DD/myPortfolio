00:00:00.993 --> 00:00:04.479
The world of security,
which we also refer to as

2
00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:08.345
cybersecurity throughout
this program, is vast.

3
00:00:08.345 --> 00:00:12.329
So making sure that you have
the knowledge, skills, and

4
00:00:12.329 --> 00:00:16.734
tools to successfully navigate
this world is why we're here.

5
00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:18.781
In the following videos,

6
00:00:18.781 --> 00:00:24.092
you'll learn about the focus of
CISSP's eight security domains.

7
00:00:24.092 --> 00:00:29.953
Then, we'll discuss threats, risks,
and vulnerabilities in more detail.

8
00:00:29.953 --> 00:00:33.316
We'll also introduce you to
the three layers of the web and

9
00:00:33.316 --> 00:00:38.257
share some examples to help you understand
the different types of attacks that we'll

10
00:00:38.257 --> 00:00:40.265
discuss throughout the program.

11
00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:46.170
Finally, we'll examine how to manage
risks by using the National Institute of

12
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:52.265
Standards and Technology's Risk Management
Framework, known as the NIST RMF.

13
00:00:53.265 --> 00:00:53.888
Because these topics and

14
00:00:53.888 --> 00:00:59.143
related technical skills are considered
core knowledge in the security field,

15
00:00:59.143 --> 00:01:03.933
continuing to build your understanding
of them will help you mitigate and

16
00:01:03.933 --> 00:01:08.591
manage the risks and threats that
organizations face on a daily basis.

17
00:01:09.591 --> 00:01:13.248
In the next video, we'll further
discuss the focus of the eight security

18
00:01:13.248 --> 00:01:15.889
domains introduced in the first course.
