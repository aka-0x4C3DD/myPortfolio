00:00:01.520 --> 00:00:02.790
Welcome back!

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:08.179
You might remember from course one that
there are eight security domains, or categories,

3
00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.140
identified by CISSP.

4
00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.652
Security teams use them to
organize daily tasks and

5
00:00:14.652 --> 00:00:19.473
identify gaps in security that could
cause negative consequences for

6
00:00:19.473 --> 00:00:23.580
an organization, and
to establish their security posture.

7
00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:28.985
Security posture refers to
an organization's ability to manage

8
00:00:28.985 --> 00:00:34.210
its defense of critical assets and
data and react to change.

9
00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.667
In this video, we'll discuss
the focus of the first four domains:

10
00:00:39.667 --> 00:00:45.800
security and risk management,
asset security,

11
00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.170
security architecture and engineering,
and communication and network security.

12
00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:53.780
The first domain is security and
risk management.

13
00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:57.738
There are several areas of focus for
this domain:

14
00:00:57.738 --> 00:01:02.639
defining security goals and
objectives, risk mitigation,

15
00:01:02.639 --> 00:01:07.470
compliance, business continuity, and
legal regulations.

16
00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.849
Let's discuss each area
of focus in more detail.

17
00:01:12.849 --> 00:01:15.580
By defining security goals and objectives,

18
00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:20.096
organizations can reduce
risks to critical assets and data

19
00:01:20.096 --> 00:01:25.420
like PII, or
personally identifiable information.

20
00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.539
Risk mitigation means having
the right procedures and rules

21
00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:35.120
in place to quickly reduce
the impact of a risk like a breach.

22
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:40.568
Compliance is the primary method used
to develop an organization's internal

23
00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:45.943
security policies, regulatory
requirements, and independent standards.

24
00:01:45.943 --> 00:01:51.103
Business continuity relates to
an organization's ability to maintain

25
00:01:51.103 --> 00:01:57.010
their everyday productivity by
establishing risk disaster recovery plans.

26
00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.703
And finally,
while laws related to security and

27
00:02:00.703 --> 00:02:06.478
risk management are different worldwide,
the overall goals are similar.

28
00:02:06.478 --> 00:02:12.397
As a security professional, this means
following rules and expectations for

29
00:02:12.397 --> 00:02:17.050
ethical behavior to minimize negligence,
abuse, or fraud.

30
00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:20.690
The next domain is asset security.

31
00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:26.690
The asset security domain is focused on
securing digital and physical assets.

32
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:30.761
It's also related to the storage,
maintenance,

33
00:02:30.761 --> 00:02:33.900
retention, and destruction of data.

34
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:39.780
This means that assets such as PII or
SPII should be securely handled and

35
00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:44.876
protected, whether stored on a computer,
transferred over

36
00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:49.788
a network like the internet, or
even physically collected.

37
00:02:49.788 --> 00:02:55.287
Organizations also need to have
policies and procedures that ensure

38
00:02:55.287 --> 00:03:00.609
data is properly stored,
maintained, retained, and destroyed.

39
00:03:00.609 --> 00:03:06.299
Knowing what data you have and who has
access to it is necessary for having

40
00:03:06.299 --> 00:03:12.290
a strong security posture that mitigates
risk to critical assets and data.

41
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.395
Previously, we provided a few examples
that touched on the disposal of data.

42
00:03:17.395 --> 00:03:22.337
For example, an organization might
have you, as a security analyst, oversee

43
00:03:22.337 --> 00:03:27.795
the destruction of hard drives to make
sure that they're properly disposed of.

44
00:03:27.795 --> 00:03:32.583
This ensures that private data stored
on those drives can't be accessed by

45
00:03:32.583 --> 00:03:34.520
threat actors.

46
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.760
The third domain is security
architecture and engineering.

47
00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.301
This domain is focused on optimizing data
security by ensuring effective tools,

48
00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:52.680
systems, and processes are in place to
protect an organization's assets and data.

49
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:58.950
One of the core concepts of secure design
architecture is shared responsibility.

50
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:03.010
Shared responsibility means
that all individuals within

51
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:06.901
an organization take an active
role in lowering risk and

52
00:04:06.901 --> 00:04:10.484
maintaining both physical and
virtual security.

53
00:04:10.484 --> 00:04:14.411
By having policies that
encourage users to recognize and

54
00:04:14.411 --> 00:04:20.071
report security concerns, many issues
can be handled quickly and effectively.

55
00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:26.642
The fourth domain is communication and
network security, which is mainly

56
00:04:26.642 --> 00:04:32.752
focused on managing and securing physical
networks and wireless communications.

57
00:04:32.752 --> 00:04:38.009
Secure networks keep an organization's
data and communications safe

58
00:04:38.009 --> 00:04:43.500
whether on-site, or in the cloud, or
when connecting to services remotely.

59
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.283
For example, employees working
remotely in public spaces need to be

60
00:04:48.283 --> 00:04:52.488
protected from vulnerabilities
that can occur when they use

61
00:04:52.488 --> 00:04:56.618
insecure bluetooth connections or
public wifi hotspots.

62
00:04:56.618 --> 00:05:02.004
By having security team members remove
access to those types of communication

63
00:05:02.004 --> 00:05:07.146
channels at the organizational level,
employees may be discouraged from

64
00:05:07.146 --> 00:05:12.230
practicing insecure behavior that
could be exploited by threat actors.

65
00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:16.370
Now that we've reviewed the focus
of our first four domains,

66
00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.801
let's discuss the last four domains.
