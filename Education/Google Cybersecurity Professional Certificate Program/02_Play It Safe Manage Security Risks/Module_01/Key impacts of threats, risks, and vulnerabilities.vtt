00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:06.700
In this video, we'll discuss an expensive
type of malware called ransomware.

2
00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.989
Then we'll cover three key
impacts of threats, risks, and

3
00:00:10.989 --> 00:00:14.980
vulnerabilities on
organizational operations.

4
00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.753
Ransomware is a malicious attack
where threat actors encrypt

5
00:00:19.753 --> 00:00:24.880
an organization's data then
demand payment to restore access.

6
00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:28.512
Once ransomware is
deployed by an attacker,

7
00:00:28.512 --> 00:00:33.292
it can freeze network systems,
leave devices unusable, and

8
00:00:33.292 --> 00:00:39.160
encrypt, or lock confidential
data, making devices inaccessible.

9
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.234
The threat actor then demands a ransom
before providing a decryption key

10
00:00:44.234 --> 00:00:49.330
to allow organizations to return to
their normal business operations.

11
00:00:49.330 --> 00:00:55.990
Think of a decryption key as a password
provided to regain access to your data.

12
00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:01.457
Note that when ransom negotiations occur
or data is leaked by threat actors,

13
00:01:01.457 --> 00:01:04.665
these events can occur
through the dark web.

14
00:01:05.665 --> 00:01:10.635
While many people use search engines to
navigate to their social media accounts or

15
00:01:10.635 --> 00:01:15.630
to shop online, this is only a small
part of what the web really is.

16
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.519
The web is actually an interlinked
network of online content that's

17
00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:25.673
made up of three layers: the surface web,
the deep web, and the dark web.

18
00:01:26.673 --> 00:01:29.232
The surface web is the layer
that most people use.

19
00:01:29.232 --> 00:01:33.700
It contains content that can be
accessed using a web browser.

20
00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:38.380
The deep web generally requires
authorization to access it.

21
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.475
An organization's intranet is
an example of the deep web,

22
00:01:42.475 --> 00:01:48.450
since it can only be accessed by employees
or others who have been granted access.

23
00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.570
Lastly, the dark web can only be
accessed by using special software.

24
00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:59.912
The dark web generally carries a negative
connotation since it is the preferred

25
00:01:59.912 --> 00:02:04.320
web layer for criminals because
of the secrecy that it provides.

26
00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:11.180
Now, let's discuss three key impacts
of threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

27
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:14.819
The first impact we'll
discuss is financial impact.

28
00:02:14.819 --> 00:02:20.033
When an organization's assets are
compromised by an attack, such as the use

29
00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:26.410
of malware, the financial consequences can
be significant for a variety of reasons.

30
00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.593
These can include interrupted
production and services,

31
00:02:30.593 --> 00:02:35.201
the cost to correct the issue, and
fines if assets are compromised

32
00:02:35.201 --> 00:02:39.880
because of non-compliance with laws and
regulations.

33
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.680
The second impact is identity theft.

34
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.688
Organizations must decide whether
to store private customer,

35
00:02:47.688 --> 00:02:51.686
employee, and outside vendor data, and
for how long.

36
00:02:51.686 --> 00:02:57.840
Storing any type of sensitive data
presents a risk to the organization.

37
00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:03.449
Sensitive data can include personally
identifiable information, or

38
00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:08.440
PII, which can be sold or
leaked through the dark web.

39
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:14.310
That's because the dark web provides
a sense of secrecy and threat actors may

40
00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.850
have the ability to sell data there
without facing legal consequences.

41
00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:25.710
The last impact we'll discuss is damage
to an organization's reputation.

42
00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:31.004
A solid customer base supports
an organization's mission,

43
00:03:31.004 --> 00:03:33.556
vision, and financial goals.

44
00:03:33.556 --> 00:03:38.208
An exploited vulnerability can lead
customers to seek new business

45
00:03:38.208 --> 00:03:40.656
relationships with competitors or

46
00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:46.900
create bad press that causes permanent
damage to an organization's reputation.

47
00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:53.123
The loss of customer data doesn't only
affect an organization's reputation and

48
00:03:53.123 --> 00:03:58.580
financials, it may also result
in legal penalties and fines.

49
00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:03.803
Organizations are strongly encouraged
to take proper security measures and

50
00:04:03.803 --> 00:04:08.784
follow certain protocols to prevent
the significant impact of threats,

51
00:04:08.784 --> 00:04:10.807
risks, and vulnerabilities.

52
00:04:10.807 --> 00:04:15.294
By using all the tools in their toolkit,
security teams are better

53
00:04:15.294 --> 00:04:19.149
prepared to handle an event
such as a ransomware attack.

54
00:04:20.149 --> 00:04:23.253
Coming up, we'll cover the NIST
risk management framework's

55
00:04:23.253 --> 00:04:25.311
seven steps for managing risk.
