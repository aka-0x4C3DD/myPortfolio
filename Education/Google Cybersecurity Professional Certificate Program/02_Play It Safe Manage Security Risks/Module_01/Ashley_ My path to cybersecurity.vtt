00:00:03.830 --> 00:00:07.485
My name is Ashley and
my role at Google

2
00:00:07.485 --> 00:00:10.815
is CE Enablement Lead
for SecOps sales.

3
00:00:10.815 --> 00:00:13.230
All that means is I
help set up training

4
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:15.915
for customer engineers
that support our products.

5
00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:18.030
Grew up with a computer,
loved the Internet.

6
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.190
I have one of the
earliest AOL screen names

7
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:21.850
in history and I'm
very proud of that.

8
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:24.210
My dad is an engineer and

9
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.510
I think there was always
an interest in tech.

10
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:29.250
But when I got out
of high school,

11
00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.830
there wasn't a clear
path to get there.

12
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.740
It wasn't a linear path at all.

13
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.585
I was a knucklehead growing up.

14
00:00:36.585 --> 00:00:38.430
I gave up in 10th grade
and I just didn't

15
00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:40.880
care for a long time
and I was getting

16
00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.010
in trouble a lot and
I pretty much told

17
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.620
myself if I don't join the
military and get out of here,

18
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.630
I will probably not be here in

19
00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:50.520
about 2-3 years if I
continue down this path.

20
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:52.310
I joined the army right out of

21
00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.560
high school, graduated in June,

22
00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.140
and four days later I was at
bootcamp at Fort Jackson,

23
00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.660
South Carolina as
a trumpet player,

24
00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.170
believe it or not, I
come back and had to get

25
00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:05.270
a job and was not

26
00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:08.420
even tracking on tech jobs
or anything like that.

27
00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.855
I was pulling in carts
for a big hardware store,

28
00:01:11.855 --> 00:01:14.335
selling video games, retail,

29
00:01:14.335 --> 00:01:17.180
box slinger for a
freight company.

30
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:19.220
All of that stuff has happened

31
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.920
before I even figured out
that tech was an option.

32
00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.465
The military was kind
enough to retrain me in IT,

33
00:01:25.465 --> 00:01:27.140
and that's kind of how I actually got

34
00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.450
the official first wave

35
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.760
of schooling to be
able to actually say,

36
00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.370
hey, I have the skills to at
least be a PC technician.

37
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.490
I went back to community
college and I actually

38
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.330
did find a cybersecurity
associates degree program,

39
00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.595
worked on some certifications.

40
00:01:43.595 --> 00:01:45.230
I went to my first DEFCON,

41
00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:46.925
which is a big
hacking conference,

42
00:01:46.925 --> 00:01:49.580
and that set off a light bulb,

43
00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:50.990
I think to actually get

44
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.840
that clarity on what the
path could look like.

45
00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.810
I landed my first
security analyst job

46
00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:59.960
back in 2017 and I went to

47
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.170
a Veterans Training
Program at my last company

48
00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.790
that was free for
vets and ended up

49
00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:06.410
getting hired out
of the training.

50
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:08.180
I was with that company for

51
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.010
almost five years before
I came to Google.

52
00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:13.025
If you're new and
you're just coming in,

53
00:02:13.025 --> 00:02:15.230
you have to know how
to work with a team.

54
00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:16.690
I think a lot of us learned that

55
00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:18.275
in customer service settings.

56
00:02:18.275 --> 00:02:20.600
Some of the skills I
learned working in retail,

57
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.045
dealing with hard customers,

58
00:02:23.045 --> 00:02:26.180
learning how to even talk
to people or diffuse

59
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.630
a situation if people
are upset about things,

60
00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:31.655
just learning how
to talk to people.

61
00:02:31.655 --> 00:02:33.580
In IT we need that.

62
00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:36.140
It's no longer just the
tech skills we need,

63
00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.170
the more T-shaped which
they're soft skills,

64
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.510
there's people skills, and
there's technical skills.

65
00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:43.550
You have to have good
analysis skills,

66
00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:44.900
and again, it doesn't even

67
00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.710
have to be technical analysis,

68
00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:48.740
if you can read a book and pick

69
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.100
apart the rhetorical
devices of that story,

70
00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.070
you can do analysis work.

71
00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.520
I didn't have to be

72
00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:57.965
a software engineer to
work in this field.

73
00:02:57.965 --> 00:03:01.085
For many of us, there's
like a math fear,

74
00:03:01.085 --> 00:03:02.990
programming is a big hurdle,

75
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.255
but we work with people,

76
00:03:05.255 --> 00:03:07.220
we work with processes,

77
00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:09.230
and you don't
necessarily need to have

78
00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:12.665
that coding knowledge to
understand people or processes.

79
00:03:12.665 --> 00:03:14.600
There's so many
ways to break in,

80
00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.150
so do not get discouraged
and don't be scared to

81
00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:20.880
think outside of the box to
get your foot in the door.
