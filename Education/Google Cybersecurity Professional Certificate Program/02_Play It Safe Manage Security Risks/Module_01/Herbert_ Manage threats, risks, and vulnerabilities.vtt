00:00:04.386 --> 00:00:06.820
My name is Herbert and
I am a Security Engineer at Google.

2
00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:09.555
I think I've always been
interested in security,

3
00:00:09.555 --> 00:00:12.681
in high school our school gave
us these huge Dell laptops.

4
00:00:12.681 --> 00:00:15.085
There wasn't a whole lot of
security within those computers.

5
00:00:15.085 --> 00:00:19.878
So, many of my friends would have cracked
versions of like video games like Halo,

6
00:00:19.878 --> 00:00:24.810
that's really where I learned how to start
manipulating computers to kind of do what

7
00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:25.311
I want.

8
00:00:25.311 --> 00:00:29.679
I guess [LAUGH] my day to day consists
of analyzing security risks and

9
00:00:29.679 --> 00:00:32.179
providing solutions to those risks.

10
00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:33.283
A typical task for

11
00:00:33.283 --> 00:00:38.299
cybersecurity analysts would usually
be something like exceptions requests.

12
00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:43.400
Analyzing if someone needs to have
special access to a device or document

13
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.850
based on the role that the person has or
the project that they're working on.

14
00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.379
One of the more common threats that we
come across is misconfigurations or

15
00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:55.370
requesting access for
something that you don't really need.

16
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:58.129
For example,
I recently had a case where a vendor we

17
00:00:58.129 --> 00:01:01.230
were working with had changed
their OAuth scope requests.

18
00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.901
And basically that means that they were
requesting more permissions to use Google

19
00:01:05.901 --> 00:01:08.355
services than they had before in the past.

20
00:01:08.355 --> 00:01:12.684
We weren't sure really how to go
about that because that wasn't

21
00:01:12.684 --> 00:01:15.418
a situation we've come across before.

22
00:01:15.418 --> 00:01:16.739
So it's still ongoing, but

23
00:01:16.739 --> 00:01:20.161
we're working with partner teams to
kind of develop a solution for that.

24
00:01:20.161 --> 00:01:24.366
I think another thing that
we've seen is outdated systems,

25
00:01:24.366 --> 00:01:26.775
machines that need to be patched.

26
00:01:26.775 --> 00:01:31.127
That sounds like an IT issue, but it's
also definitely a cybersecurity issue.

27
00:01:31.127 --> 00:01:37.148
Having outdated machines, not having
proper device management policies,

28
00:01:37.148 --> 00:01:41.610
working with a team or
many teams is a huge part of the job.

29
00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.362
In order to get really anything done, you
need to communicate with not just the team

30
00:01:45.362 --> 00:01:47.468
that you're a part of,
but with other teams.

31
00:01:47.468 --> 00:01:51.852
Ten years ago I was working at
a pizza joint and ten years later,

32
00:01:51.852 --> 00:01:54.860
here I am, at Google as a Security Engineer.

33
00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.934
If I told my 16 year old
self that I would be here,

34
00:01:58.934 --> 00:02:03.501
I wouldn't have believed myself,
but it is possible.
