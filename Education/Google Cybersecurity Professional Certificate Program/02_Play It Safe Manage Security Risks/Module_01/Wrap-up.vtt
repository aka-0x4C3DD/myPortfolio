00:00:01.294 --> 00:00:04.801
You've now completed the first
section of this course!

2
00:00:04.801 --> 00:00:08.001
Let's review what we've discussed so far.

3
00:00:09.001 --> 00:00:14.729
We started out by exploring the focus
of CISSP's eight security domains.

4
00:00:14.729 --> 00:00:17.985
Then, we discussed threats, risks, and

5
00:00:17.985 --> 00:00:22.689
vulnerabilities, and
how they can impact organizations.

6
00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.419
This included a close
examination of ransomware and

7
00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:29.820
an introduction to the three
layers of the web.

8
00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.171
Finally, we focused on seven
steps of the NIST Risk

9
00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:37.923
Management Framework, also called the RMF.

10
00:00:38.923 --> 00:00:42.882
You did a fantastic job adding new
knowledge to your security analyst

11
00:00:42.882 --> 00:00:43.662
toolkit.

12
00:00:43.662 --> 00:00:47.476
In upcoming videos,
we'll go into more detail about

13
00:00:47.476 --> 00:00:51.638
some common tools used by
entry-level security analysts.

14
00:00:51.638 --> 00:00:56.586
Then, you'll have an opportunity to
analyze data generated by those

15
00:00:56.586 --> 00:01:00.940
tools to identify risks,
threats, or vulnerabilities.

16
00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:05.316
You'll also have a chance to use
a playbook to respond to incidents.

17
00:01:05.316 --> 00:01:06.632
That's all for now.

18
00:01:06.632 --> 00:01:08.089
Keep up the great work!
