00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.660
My name is Zack. I'm a
Software Engineer on

2
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.880
the security team in
Google Workspace.

3
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:10.310
I have non-traditional
background.

4
00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.670
When I graduated
college, I originally

5
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:13.065
thought that I would pursue law,

6
00:00:13.065 --> 00:00:15.855
but I was accepted and
I decided not to go.

7
00:00:15.855 --> 00:00:18.075
Instead, I joined
Google in recruiting.

8
00:00:18.075 --> 00:00:19.950
Through that work, I
did a little bit of

9
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:21.600
strategy work where
I taught myself

10
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.250
web scraping and I
really liked it, so

11
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.360
I took one of

12
00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.460
Google's internal training
courses that helped me

13
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.870
move from recruiting to
software engineering.

14
00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:30.605
Processes and playbooks are

15
00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:33.380
documentation that software
engineers and other people at

16
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.720
Google use to
determine how we can

17
00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.380
respond to things that happen.

18
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:41.210
Whether that's a security
or privacy incident,

19
00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.965
whether that's an active attack,

20
00:00:42.965 --> 00:00:45.005
we have sets of guidelines or

21
00:00:45.005 --> 00:00:47.135
algorithms that we
use to determine

22
00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:49.730
the best course of action
to make sure that we manage

23
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.475
people's data and security well.

24
00:00:52.475 --> 00:00:55.250
I'm relatively new
to cybersecurity.

25
00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.725
I've been a software engineer
here for about two years,

26
00:00:57.725 --> 00:01:00.320
and I don't have
enough knowledge

27
00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:01.970
to be able to respond to

28
00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:03.260
every single thing that could

29
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.670
possibly come my way when I'm on

30
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.400
call or when I'm helping
resolve a vulnerability.

31
00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:08.960
The playbooks are
super important

32
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.850
to people like me and
other folks who are

33
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:14.420
joining the industry new
because they allow you to solve

34
00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.820
the problem with the experience

35
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.470
of a much more
experienced person,

36
00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.900
basically decades
of experience in

37
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:22.670
your own resolution
because you can

38
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:24.985
rely on this playbook and
other people's advice.

39
00:01:24.985 --> 00:01:28.565
The kind of things that we use
playbooks for our open attacks,

40
00:01:28.565 --> 00:01:31.490
privacy incidents, data leaks,

41
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.990
denial of service attacks,

42
00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.110
service alerts, and others.

43
00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:36.980
When I first started
out at Google,

44
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.860
my first task on
the security team

45
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:43.100
was to fix an externally
reported vulnerability.

46
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:45.335
That means some
security researcher

47
00:01:45.335 --> 00:01:46.700
out in the wild was playing with

48
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.380
our app and found
something that could

49
00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.715
potentially leak
our user's data.

50
00:01:50.715 --> 00:01:51.920
When I received that,

51
00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.720
it was my first
task on the team.

52
00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:55.550
Looking back on it, it's

53
00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.900
a relatively easy
thing to solve,

54
00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.120
but it felt really
overwhelming at the time.

55
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.820
But when we receive a
vulnerability report,

56
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.590
it comes with
remediation guidance.

57
00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:06.320
There were steps in
the bug that was sent

58
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.550
to me saying this

59
00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.120
is the things that we
think that you should do.

60
00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.100
The things that I would say to

61
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.360
somebody who's interested
in starting out in

62
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.890
cybersecurity is
talk to as

63
00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.915
many people in the
industry as you can.

64
00:02:14.915 --> 00:02:16.890
You'll learn about
what the job is like.

65
00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:18.350
You'll learn about
the skills that you

66
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.140
need to get yourself there.

67
00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:21.855
If that's something that
you're interested in,

68
00:02:21.855 --> 00:02:23.810
you'll learn about
open jobs and roles,

69
00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:25.705
what it's like to work
at different companies.

70
00:02:25.705 --> 00:02:28.100
I wish people had told
me when I graduated

71
00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.875
college that what these
jobs are really like.

72
00:02:30.875 --> 00:02:33.530
I thought that coding
would be heads down,

73
00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:34.640
typing away at a computer and

74
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.380
a dark office for
12 hours a day.

75
00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:37.610
But it's not like that at all.

76
00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.770
50% is communicating with

77
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:40.820
other people and reviewing

78
00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.980
designs and talking about ideas.

79
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.510
That's really compelling and I

80
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:45.710
think if somebody had said that

81
00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:46.880
to me at the beginning of my

82
00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.370
career would have been
totally different.

83
00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:50.480
Some teams come in
and out of fashion,

84
00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.115
but security is ever-present.

85
00:02:52.115 --> 00:02:53.330
It's really important now it's

86
00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.515
only getting more important.

87
00:02:54.515 --> 00:02:57.170
There's a certain amount
of security that comes

88
00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:58.550
with being in a security team.

89
00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:00.810
Definitely, a good place to be.
