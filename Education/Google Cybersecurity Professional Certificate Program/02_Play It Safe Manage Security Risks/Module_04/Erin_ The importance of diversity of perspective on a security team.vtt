00:00:04.284 --> 00:00:05.838
Hi everyone.
My name is Erin and

3
00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:08.304
I am a privacy engineer at Google.

4
00:00:08.304 --> 00:00:10.858
I work on speculative and
emerging technology.

5
00:00:10.858 --> 00:00:14.211
So think of things that don't
exist in the world, and

6
00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:17.349
that are coming within
the next two to five years.

7
00:00:17.349 --> 00:00:21.471
My role is basically to take a look at
all of the things that we are creating

8
00:00:21.471 --> 00:00:25.741
in terms of technology, and making
sure that privacy is embedded in that.

9
00:00:25.741 --> 00:00:28.974
I am thinking for
users before they even touch the product,

10
00:00:28.974 --> 00:00:31.239
making sure that when they utilize them,

11
00:00:31.239 --> 00:00:35.069
they'll have some form of trust in
the engagement with that product.

12
00:00:35.069 --> 00:00:37.661
As well as knowing that we
are protecting their privacy,

13
00:00:37.661 --> 00:00:40.145
things that they don't want to share or
broadcast, and

14
00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:43.442
making sure that they're informed
before they even touch the product.

15
00:00:43.442 --> 00:00:48.390
I always talk about soft skills being the
most important thing over the technical

16
00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:48.979
skills.

17
00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:53.999
Because we can teach you anything but we
can't teach you how to relate to people.

18
00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:56.283
That is something that
you bring to the table.

19
00:00:56.283 --> 00:01:00.573
Diversity of thought and diversity
of perspectives are very useful in

20
00:01:00.573 --> 00:01:03.201
understanding the world that we exist in.

21
00:01:03.201 --> 00:01:06.240
Because if we are designing products for
everyday people,

22
00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.264
we need everyday people to basically
help us understand those perspectives.

23
00:01:10.264 --> 00:01:12.659
Because I may look at something one way,
but

24
00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:16.371
my colleague may see it another way
based on their own experiences.

25
00:01:16.371 --> 00:01:21.042
And so, when you work together and come
from different environments, you actually

26
00:01:21.042 --> 00:01:25.015
bring more equity and more depth to
the things that you're looking at.

27
00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:29.738
And the perspective that you bring
is the essential voice that is

28
00:01:29.738 --> 00:01:32.984
required in order to
make a product better.

29
00:01:32.984 --> 00:01:37.370
When you look at people who work in
journalism, or people who, like myself,

30
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.417
worked in entertainment, they are bringing
a different perspective for

31
00:01:41.417 --> 00:01:43.383
how they would tackle something.

32
00:01:43.383 --> 00:01:47.143
Or if we have a product where we
are trying to convince a product team that

33
00:01:47.143 --> 00:01:51.657
maybe we shouldn't do this, it's always
helpful to say, from someone who worked in

34
00:01:51.657 --> 00:01:54.751
journalism, do we really want
this to end up in The Times?

35
00:01:54.751 --> 00:01:55.619
Probably not, right?

36
00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:58.816
And that is a way to come at people that,
on the ground floor,

37
00:01:58.816 --> 00:02:00.901
they understand what that looks like.

38
00:02:00.901 --> 00:02:05.506
All of the experiences that you have
had from the time you were born to now,

39
00:02:05.506 --> 00:02:07.598
they have been your experience.

40
00:02:07.598 --> 00:02:12.004
And you have to think about that in terms
of where we're going with technology.

41
00:02:12.004 --> 00:02:15.409
When we're developing for
a wide array of people,

42
00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:18.983
your experience may be
someone else's experience.

43
00:02:18.983 --> 00:02:23.354
And so if we don't have you in the room,
then we are missing the opportunity to

44
00:02:23.354 --> 00:02:27.339
actually bring something beautiful,
I would say, to the equation.

45
00:02:27.339 --> 00:02:31.838
Which is why I encourage people, please
come work with us in terms of technology.

46
00:02:31.838 --> 00:02:37.207
Get involved in STEM because
the equity across product security,

47
00:02:37.207 --> 00:02:41.939
privacy, you name it,
whether it be software engineering,

48
00:02:41.939 --> 00:02:45.130
everything requires a different voice.

49
00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:47.169
And it actually requires your voice.

50
00:02:47.169 --> 00:02:47.669
