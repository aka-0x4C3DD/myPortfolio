00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:03.880
Let's review what we
covered in this section.

2
00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.220
We began by discussing
the purpose of playbooks.

3
00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:13.120
Then, we examined the six phases
of an incident response playbook,

4
00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:19.120
including an example of how a playbook
might be used to address an incident.

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:24.943
Playbooks are just one of the essential
tools you'll use as a security analyst.

6
00:00:24.943 --> 00:00:29.870
They provide a structured, consistent
approach to handling security incidents

7
00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.407
and can help you respond to
security incidents quickly.

8
00:00:34.407 --> 00:00:38.273
Knowing how and when to use a playbook,
will allow you to make informed

9
00:00:38.273 --> 00:00:43.154
decisions about how to respond to
a security incident when it occurs

10
00:00:43.154 --> 00:00:45.503
and help to minimize the impact and

11
00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:49.879
damage it may cause your organization and
the people it serves.

12
00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:54.698
Following the steps of the playbook and
communicating appropriately with your team,

13
00:00:54.698 --> 00:00:59.450
will ensure your effectiveness
as a security professional.
