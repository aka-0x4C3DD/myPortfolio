00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.530
Previously, we discussed
how SIEM tools are used to

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.770
help protect an organization's
critical assets and data.

3
00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.265
In this video, we'll introduce

4
00:00:11.265 --> 00:00:13.170
another important tool for

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.720
maintaining an
organization's security,

6
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.220
known as a playbook.

7
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.040
A playbook is a
manual that provides

8
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.460
details about any
operational action.

9
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:26.520
Playbooks also
clarify what tools

10
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.760
should be used in response
to a security incident.

11
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:31.560
In the security field,

12
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.715
playbooks are essential.

13
00:00:34.715 --> 00:00:38.990
Urgency, efficiency, and
accuracy are necessary to

14
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.045
quickly identify and mitigate

15
00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:44.455
a security threat to
reduce potential risk.

16
00:00:44.455 --> 00:00:47.120
Playbooks ensure
that people follow

17
00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.425
a consistent list of actions
in a prescribed way,

18
00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:54.740
regardless of who is
working on the case.

19
00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:58.055
Different types of
playbooks are used.

20
00:00:58.055 --> 00:01:01.535
These include playbooks
for incident response,

21
00:01:01.535 --> 00:01:03.260
security alerts,

22
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.095
teams-specific, and product-specific
purposes.

23
00:01:08.095 --> 00:01:10.760
Here, we'll focus on a playbook
that's commonly used in

24
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.250
cybersecurity, called an
incident response playbook.

25
00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:18.710
Incident response
is an organization's

26
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:21.680
quick attempt to
identify an attack,

27
00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.750
contain the damage, and

28
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.330
correct the effects
of a security breach.

29
00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:30.230
An incident response
playbook is a guide with

30
00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:32.930
six phases used to
help mitigate and

31
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.695
manage security incidents
from beginning to end.

32
00:01:36.695 --> 00:01:39.620
Let's discuss each phase.

33
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:42.905
The first phase is preparation.

34
00:01:42.905 --> 00:01:45.950
Organizations must prepare to

35
00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.290
mitigate the likelihood, risk,

36
00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.550
and impact of

37
00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:53.030
a security incident by
documenting procedures,

38
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.665
establishing staffing
plans, and educating users.

39
00:01:57.665 --> 00:02:00.485
Preparation sets the foundation

40
00:02:00.485 --> 00:02:02.810
for successful
incident response.

41
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:05.870
For example, organizations

42
00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.090
can create incident
response plans and

43
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.790
procedures that
outline the roles and

44
00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:14.455
responsibilities of each
security team member.

45
00:02:15.455 --> 00:02:18.980
The second phase is
detection and analysis.

46
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.150
The objective of this phase
is to detect and analyze

47
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:27.545
events using defined
processes and technology.

48
00:02:27.545 --> 00:02:29.750
Using appropriate tools and

49
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.390
strategies during
this phase helps

50
00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.120
security analysts determine
whether a breach has

51
00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.145
occurred and analyze
its possible magnitude.

52
00:02:40.145 --> 00:02:41.970
The third phase is containment.

53
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:44.630
The goal of containment
is to prevent

54
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:46.490
further damage and reduce

55
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.625
the immediate impact of
a security incident.

56
00:02:49.625 --> 00:02:53.480
During this phase, security
professionals take

57
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:57.395
actions to contain an
incident and minimize damage.

58
00:02:57.395 --> 00:03:01.550
Containment is a high
priority for organizations

59
00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:02.975
because it helps prevent

60
00:03:02.975 --> 00:03:06.530
ongoing risks to critical
assets and data.

61
00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:09.200
The fourth phase in
an incident response

62
00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:12.350
playbook is eradication
and recovery.

63
00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:16.115
This phase involves the complete
removal of an incident's

64
00:03:16.115 --> 00:03:18.500
artifacts so that
an organization

65
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.975
can return to normal operations.

66
00:03:20.975 --> 00:03:22.670
During this phase,

67
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:25.730
security professionals
eliminate artifacts of

68
00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.440
the incident by removing

69
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.590
malicious code and
mitigating vulnerabilities.

70
00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:33.725
Once they've exercised
due diligence,

71
00:03:33.725 --> 00:03:35.150
they can begin to restore

72
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:38.255
the affected environment
to a secure state.

73
00:03:38.255 --> 00:03:42.490
This is also known
as IT restoration.

74
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.190
The fifth phase is post-incident
activity.

75
00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:50.690
This phase includes
documenting the incident,

76
00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.270
informing organizational
leadership,

77
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.240
and applying lessons
learned to ensure that

78
00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.920
an organization is better

79
00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:00.440
prepared to handle
future incidents.

80
00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.385
Depending on the severity
of the incident,

81
00:04:03.385 --> 00:04:08.330
organizations can conduct a
full-scale incident analysis

82
00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.070
to determine the root cause

83
00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:13.430
of the incident and
implement various updates

84
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.225
or improvements to enhance
its overall security posture.

85
00:04:18.225 --> 00:04:19.490
The sixth and final phase in

86
00:04:19.490 --> 00:04:22.715
an incident response
playbook is coordination.

87
00:04:22.715 --> 00:04:25.340
Coordination involves
reporting incidents

88
00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.140
and sharing
information, throughout

89
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.630
the incident response
process, based

90
00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.540
on the organization's
established standards.

91
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.990
Coordination is important
for many reasons.

92
00:04:35.990 --> 00:04:38.630
It ensures that
organizations meet

93
00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:41.210
compliance requirements and it

94
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:44.255
allows for coordinated
response and resolution.

95
00:04:45.255 --> 00:04:45.770
There are many ways

96
00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.370
security professionals may
be alerted to an incident.

97
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:50.930
You recently learned about

98
00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:55.045
SIEM tools and how they
collect and analyze data.

99
00:04:55.045 --> 00:04:58.700
They use this data to
detect threats and generate

100
00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.620
alerts, which can inform

101
00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:03.500
the security team of
a potential incident.

102
00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:07.640
Then, when a security
analyst receives a SIEM alert,

103
00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.995
they can use the
appropriate playbook

104
00:05:09.995 --> 00:05:12.550
to guide the response process.

105
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.950
SIEM tools and playbooks
work together to provide

106
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.140
a structured and
efficient way of

107
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.275
responding to potential
security incidents.

108
00:05:22.275 --> 00:05:22.915
Throughout the program,

109
00:05:22.915 --> 00:05:25.550
you'll have opportunities
to continue to build

110
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:29.070
your understanding of
these important concepts.
