00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.610
Welcome back!

2
00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.974
In this video,

3
00:00:03.974 --> 00:00:05.280
we're going to revisit

4
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.980
SIEM tools and how
they're used alongside

5
00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.235
playbooks to reduce
organizational threats,

6
00:00:11.235 --> 00:00:13.935
risks, and vulnerabilities.

7
00:00:14.935 --> 00:00:16.380
An incident response playbook is

8
00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:19.320
a guide that helps
security professionals

9
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:21.945
mitigate issues with
a heightened sense of

10
00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:25.305
urgency, while
maintaining accuracy.

11
00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:29.550
Playbooks create structure,
ensure compliance,

12
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:31.620
and outline processes for

13
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:34.095
communication and documentation.

14
00:00:34.095 --> 00:00:37.140
Organizations may use
different types of

15
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:40.785
incident response playbooks
depending on the situation.

16
00:00:40.785 --> 00:00:44.000
For example, an
organization may have

17
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.219
specific playbooks
for addressing

18
00:00:46.219 --> 00:00:48.005
different types of attacks,

19
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:50.960
such as ransomware, malware,

20
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:54.550
distributed denial of
service, and more.

21
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.120
To start, let's discuss how
a security analyst might use

22
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.250
a playbook to address a SIEM alert,
like a potential malware attack.

23
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.140
In this situation, a
playbook is invaluable for

24
00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:10.610
guiding an analyst through

25
00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.540
the necessary actions to
properly address the alert.

26
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.625
The first action in the playbook
is to assess the alert.

27
00:01:18.625 --> 00:01:21.650
This means determining
if the alert is actually

28
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.780
valid by identifying why

29
00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:26.170
the alert was
generated by the SIEM.

30
00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:28.460
This can be done by analyzing

31
00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:30.875
log data and related metrics.

32
00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:34.970
Next, the playbook outlines
the actions and tools to

33
00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.990
use to contain the malware
and reduce further damage.

34
00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:41.700
For example, this
playbook instructs

35
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.375
the analyst to
isolate, or disconnect,

36
00:01:44.375 --> 00:01:46.820
the infected network
system to prevent

37
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.590
the malware from spreading

38
00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:51.100
into other parts of the network.

39
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.700
After containing the incident,

40
00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.240
step three of the playbook describes

41
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.825
ways to eliminate all
traces of the incident

42
00:01:59.825 --> 00:02:02.015
and restore the affected systems

43
00:02:02.015 --> 00:02:04.325
back to normal operations.

44
00:02:04.325 --> 00:02:07.620
For example, the
playbook might instruct

45
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.555
the analyst to restore the
impacted operating system,

46
00:02:11.555 --> 00:02:14.750
then restore the
affected data using

47
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:18.830
a clean backup, created
before the malware outbreak.

48
00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.445
Finally, once the incident
has been resolved,

49
00:02:22.445 --> 00:02:26.675
step four of the playbook instructs
the analyst to perform

50
00:02:26.675 --> 00:02:29.345
various post-incident
activities

51
00:02:29.345 --> 00:02:32.375
and coordination efforts
with the security team.

52
00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:35.840
Some actions include
creating a final report to

53
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.305
communicate the security
incident to stakeholders,

54
00:02:39.305 --> 00:02:43.280
or reporting the incident to
the appropriate authorities,

55
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.490
like the U.S. Federal
Bureau of Investigations

56
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.155
or other agencies that
investigate cyber crimes.

57
00:02:51.155 --> 00:02:52.610
This is just one example of how

58
00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.175
you might follow the
steps in a playbook,

59
00:02:55.175 --> 00:02:58.985
since organizations develop
their own internal procedures

60
00:02:58.985 --> 00:03:01.205
for addressing
security incidents.

61
00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:05.419
What's most important to
understand is that playbooks

62
00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:07.790
provide a consistent process

63
00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.630
for security
professionals to follow.

64
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.000
Note that playbooks
are living documents,

65
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.570
meaning the security team
will make frequent changes,

66
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.180
updates, and improvements to

67
00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:23.320
address new threats
and vulnerabilities.

68
00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.600
In addition,
organizations learn from

69
00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.790
past security incidents to

70
00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.860
improve their security posture,

71
00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.425
refine policies and procedures,

72
00:03:33.425 --> 00:03:37.885
and reduce the likelihood and
impact of future incidents.

73
00:03:37.885 --> 00:03:41.595
Then, they update their
playbooks accordingly.

74
00:03:42.595 --> 00:03:44.449
As an entry-level
security analyst,

75
00:03:44.449 --> 00:03:47.855
you may be required to
use playbooks frequently,

76
00:03:47.855 --> 00:03:50.060
especially when
monitoring networks

77
00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:52.360
and responding to incidents.

78
00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.470
Having an understanding of why

79
00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:57.170
playbooks are important
and how they can help you

80
00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:59.570
achieve your working
objectives will

81
00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:03.390
help ensure your success
within this field.
