00:00:00.851 --> 00:00:02.888
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:02.888 --> 00:00:06.276
You've reached the final
section of this course!

3
00:00:06.276 --> 00:00:09.921
Previously, we discussed
security information and

4
00:00:09.921 --> 00:00:12.513
event management, or SIEM tools, and

5
00:00:12.513 --> 00:00:17.706
how they can be used to help organizations
improve their security posture.

6
00:00:18.706 --> 00:00:22.383
Let's continue our security
journey by exploring another tool

7
00:00:22.383 --> 00:00:25.593
security professionals use: playbooks.

8
00:00:25.593 --> 00:00:31.114
In this section, we'll explore how
playbooks help security teams respond

9
00:00:31.114 --> 00:00:36.040
to threats, risks, or
vulnerabilities identified by SIEM tools.

10
00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.275
Then, we'll discuss the six
phases of incident response.

11
00:00:40.275 --> 00:00:41.495
Let's get started!
