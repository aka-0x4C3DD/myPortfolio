00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.675
My name is Ashley, and I'm
a Customer Engineering Enablement Lead for

2
00:00:05.675 --> 00:00:08.720
Security Operation Sales at Google.

3
00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.880
I'm excited to be your instructor for
this course.

4
00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:16.535
Let's start by quickly reviewing
what we've covered so far.

5
00:00:16.535 --> 00:00:18.913
Earlier, we defined security and

6
00:00:18.913 --> 00:00:23.850
explored some common job responsibilities
for entry-level analysts.

7
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:30.030
We also discussed core skills and
knowledge that analysts need to develop.

8
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:35.290
Then, we shared some key events like
the LoveLetter and Morris attacks

9
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:41.120
that led to the development and
ongoing evolution of the security field.

10
00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.620
We also introduced you to frameworks,
controls, and

11
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.627
the CIA triad, which are all
used to reduce risk.

12
00:00:50.627 --> 00:00:55.921
In this course, we'll discuss the focus
of Certified Information Systems Security Professional's,

13
00:00:55.921 --> 00:01:01.005
or CISSP's,
eight security domains.

14
00:01:01.005 --> 00:01:05.731
We'll also cover security frameworks and
controls in more detail,

15
00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:09.450
with a focus on NIST's Risk
Management Framework.

16
00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.892
Additionally, we'll explore
security audits, including common

17
00:01:13.892 --> 00:01:15.959
elements of internal audits.

18
00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:20.042
Then, we'll introduce some
basic security tools, and

19
00:01:20.042 --> 00:01:25.658
you'll have a chance to explore how to
use security tools to protect assets and data

20
00:01:25.658 --> 00:01:29.417
from threats, risks,
and vulnerabilities.

21
00:01:30.417 --> 00:01:34.091
Securing an organization and
its assets from threats, risks, and

22
00:01:34.091 --> 00:01:39.440
vulnerabilities is an important step
in maintaining business operations.

23
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:44.513
In my experience as a security analyst,
I helped respond to

24
00:01:44.513 --> 00:01:50.620
a severe breach that cost
the organization nearly $250,000.

25
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:55.385
So, I hope you're feeling motivated
to continue your security journey.

26
00:01:55.385 --> 00:01:56.845
I know I'm excited.

27
00:01:56.845 --> 00:01:58.154
Let's get started!
