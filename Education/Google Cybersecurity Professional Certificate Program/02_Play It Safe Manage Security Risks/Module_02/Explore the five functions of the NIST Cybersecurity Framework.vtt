00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:03.720
Hello again!
I'm excited you're here.

2
00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.405
We have so much to discuss.

3
00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:08.880
Previously, we covered the uses

4
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.230
and benefits of the NIST CSF.

5
00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:14.670
In this video, we'll
focus specifically on

6
00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:18.435
the five core functions of
the NIST CSF framework.

7
00:00:18.435 --> 00:00:19.920
Let's get started.

8
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.515
NIST CSF focuses on five
core functions: identify,

9
00:00:25.515 --> 00:00:31.109
protect, detect,
respond, and recover.

10
00:00:31.109 --> 00:00:33.045
These core functions help

11
00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:36.130
organizations manage
cybersecurity risks,

12
00:00:36.130 --> 00:00:38.735
implement risk
management strategies,

13
00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:41.225
and learn from
previous mistakes.

14
00:00:41.225 --> 00:00:44.570
Basically, when it comes
to security operations,

15
00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:46.610
NIST CSF functions are

16
00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.220
key for making sure
an organization is

17
00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:51.440
protected against
potential threats,

18
00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.355
risks, and vulnerabilities.

19
00:00:54.355 --> 00:00:57.320
So let's take a little
time to explore how

20
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.120
each function can be used to

21
00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.050
improve an
organization's security.

22
00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:04.275
The first core function is

23
00:01:04.275 --> 00:01:07.670
identify, which is related
to the management of

24
00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:10.250
cybersecurity risk
and its effect on

25
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.130
an organization's
people and assets.

26
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.235
For example, as a
security analyst,

27
00:01:16.235 --> 00:01:19.870
you may be asked to monitor
systems and devices in

28
00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:23.440
your organization's internal
network to identify

29
00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.500
potential security issues

30
00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.400
The second core function is
protect, which is the strategy

31
00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.410
used to protect an organization

32
00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:34.825
through the implementation
of policies,

33
00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:37.030
procedures, training,

34
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:40.840
and tools that help mitigate
cybersecurity threats.

35
00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.100
For example, as a
security analyst,

36
00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.100
you and your team
might encounter

37
00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.805
new and unfamiliar
threats and attacks.

38
00:01:49.805 --> 00:01:52.360
For this reason, studying
historical data and

39
00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:54.265
making improvements to policies

40
00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:56.000
and procedures is essential.

41
00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.380
The third core function
is detect, which

42
00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:03.200
means identifying potential
security incidents

43
00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:06.000
and improving monitoring
capabilities to

44
00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.320
increase the speed and
efficiency of detections.

45
00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.279
For example, as an analyst,

46
00:02:12.279 --> 00:02:13.690
you might be asked to review

47
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:18.325
a new security tool's setup to
make sure it's flagging low,

48
00:02:18.325 --> 00:02:20.400
medium, or high risk,

49
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500
and then alerting the
security team about

50
00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.000
any potential threats
or incidents.

51
00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
The fourth function is
respond, which means making

52
00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.230
sure that the proper procedures
are used to contain,

53
00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:33.500
neutralize,

54
00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.000
and analyze security
incidents, and

55
00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.280
implement improvements
to the security process.

56
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.000
As an analyst, you could be

57
00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.400
working with a team
to collect and

58
00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.200
organize data to document
an incident and suggest

59
00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.240
improvements to processes to

60
00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.290
prevent the incident
from happening again.

61
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.560
The fifth core function is

62
00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:58.040
recover, which is the process of

63
00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.720
returning affected systems
back to normal operation.

64
00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.950
For example, as an
entry-level security analyst,

65
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.665
you might work with
your security team

66
00:03:09.665 --> 00:03:11.315
to restore systems,

67
00:03:11.315 --> 00:03:14.000
data, and assets, such as

68
00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.670
financial or legal
files, that have

69
00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:19.804
been affected by an
incident like a breach.

70
00:03:20.804 --> 00:03:23.060
We've covered a lot of
information in this video.

71
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.640
Hopefully, it helped you

72
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.200
understand the value
of learning about

73
00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.295
the NIST CSF and its
five core functions.

74
00:03:31.295 --> 00:03:35.400
From proactive to reactive
measures, all five functions are

75
00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.720
essential for making sure
that an organization

76
00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.780
has effective security
strategies in place.

77
00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:44.600
Security incidents
are going to happen,

78
00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.200
but an organization must have

79
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.200
the ability to
quickly recover from

80
00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.500
any damage caused by an incident

81
00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:52.315
to minimize their level of risk.

82
00:03:53.315 --> 00:03:54.220
Coming up, we'll discuss

83
00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.100
security principles that
work hand-in-hand with

84
00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.310
NIST frameworks
and the CIA triad

85
00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.280
to help protect critical
data and assets.
