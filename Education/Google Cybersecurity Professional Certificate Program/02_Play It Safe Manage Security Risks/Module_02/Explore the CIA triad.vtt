00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:02.909
Great to see you again!

2
00:00:02.909 --> 00:00:08.170
While working as an entry-level security
analyst, your main responsibility is to

3
00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:13.296
help protect your organization's sensitive
assets and data from threat actors.

4
00:00:13.296 --> 00:00:18.567
The CIA triad is a core security
model that will help you do that.

5
00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:23.733
In this video, we'll explore the CIA
triad and discuss the importance of each

6
00:00:23.733 --> 00:00:29.804
component for keeping an organization safe
from threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

7
00:00:29.804 --> 00:00:31.741
Let's get started!

8
00:00:32.741 --> 00:00:35.922
The CIA triad is a model that
helps inform how organizations

9
00:00:35.922 --> 00:00:40.363
consider risk when setting up systems and
security policies.

10
00:00:40.363 --> 00:00:45.000
As a reminder, the three letters
in the CIA triad stand for

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.084
confidentiality, integrity, and
availability.

12
00:00:49.084 --> 00:00:54.044
As an entry-level analyst, you'll
find yourself constantly referring to

13
00:00:54.044 --> 00:00:58.848
these three core principles as you
work to protect your organization and the people

14
00:00:58.848 --> 00:01:00.359
it serves.

15
00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:06.124
Confidentiality means that only authorized
users can access specific assets or data.

16
00:01:06.124 --> 00:01:10.650
Sensitive data should be available
on a "need to know" basis, so

17
00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.926
that only the people who are authorized to
handle certain assets or data have access.

18
00:01:17.926 --> 00:01:22.246
Integrity means that the data is correct,
authentic, and reliable.

19
00:01:22.246 --> 00:01:27.624
Determining the integrity of data and
analyzing how it's used will help you, as

20
00:01:27.624 --> 00:01:32.933
a security professional, decide whether
the data can or cannot be trusted.

21
00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:37.107
Availability means that the data
is accessible to those who

22
00:01:37.107 --> 00:01:39.202
are authorized to access it.

23
00:01:39.202 --> 00:01:41.593
Inaccessible data isn't useful and

24
00:01:41.593 --> 00:01:44.991
can prevent people from
being able to do their jobs.

25
00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:49.272
As a security professional, ensuring
that systems, networks, and

26
00:01:49.272 --> 00:01:53.254
applications are functioning
properly to allow for timely and

27
00:01:53.254 --> 00:01:57.928
reliable access, may be a part of
your everyday work responsibilities.

28
00:01:58.928 --> 00:02:02.008
Now that we've defined the CIA triad and
its components,

29
00:02:02.008 --> 00:02:07.057
let's explore how you might use the CIA
triad to protect an organization.

30
00:02:07.057 --> 00:02:12.066
If you work for an organization that has
large amounts of private data like a bank,

31
00:02:12.066 --> 00:02:15.481
the principle of confidentiality
is essential because

32
00:02:15.481 --> 00:02:19.929
the bank must keep people's personal and
financial information safe.

33
00:02:20.929 --> 00:02:22.728
The principle of integrity
is also a priority.

34
00:02:22.728 --> 00:02:25.732
For example,
if a person's spending habits or

35
00:02:25.732 --> 00:02:30.464
purchasing locations change dramatically,
the bank will likely disable

36
00:02:30.464 --> 00:02:34.743
access to the account until they
can verify that the account owner,

37
00:02:34.743 --> 00:02:38.363
not a threat actor, is actually
the one making purchases.

38
00:02:39.363 --> 00:02:41.588
The availability principle
is also critical.

39
00:02:41.588 --> 00:02:44.932
Banks put a lot of effort
into making sure that people

40
00:02:44.932 --> 00:02:48.589
can access their account
information easily on the web.

41
00:02:48.589 --> 00:02:53.209
And to make sure that information is
protected from threat actors, banks

42
00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.675
use a validation process to help
minimize damage if they suspect that

43
00:02:57.675 --> 00:03:00.538
customer accounts have been compromised.

44
00:03:01.538 --> 00:03:04.382
As an analyst,
you'll regularly use each component of

45
00:03:04.382 --> 00:03:09.229
the triad to help protect your
organization and the people it serves.

46
00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.248
And having the CIA triad
constantly in mind,

47
00:03:12.248 --> 00:03:17.336
will help you keep sensitive data and
assets safe from a variety of threats,

48
00:03:17.336 --> 00:03:22.186
risks, and vulnerabilities including
the social engineering attacks,

49
00:03:22.186 --> 00:03:25.308
malware, and
data theft we discussed earlier.

50
00:03:26.308 --> 00:03:30.035
Coming up, we'll explore specific
frameworks and principles that will also

51
00:03:30.035 --> 00:03:34.917
help you protect your organization from
threats, risks, and vulnerabilities.

52
00:03:34.917 --> 00:03:35.848
See you soon!
