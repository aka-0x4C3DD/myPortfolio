00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.335
Welcome back!
As a security analyst,

2
00:00:04.335 --> 00:00:07.965
your job isn't just
keeping organizations safe.

3
00:00:07.965 --> 00:00:10.305
Your role is much
more important.

4
00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:13.140
You're also helping
to keep people safe.

5
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.320
Breaches that affect
customers', vendors',

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:20.280
and employees' data can
cause significant damage to

7
00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.510
people's financial stability
and their reputations.

8
00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.675
As an analyst, your
day-to-day work

9
00:00:27.675 --> 00:00:31.320
will help keep people
and organizations safe.

10
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.464
In this section of the course,

11
00:00:33.464 --> 00:00:37.215
we'll discuss security
frameworks, controls,

12
00:00:37.215 --> 00:00:41.180
and design principles in more
detail, and how they can be

13
00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:43.550
applied to security
audits to help

14
00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:46.390
protect organizations
and people.

15
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.340
Keeping customer
information confidential is

16
00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.700
a crucial part of my
daily work at Google.

17
00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:55.385
The NIST Cybersecurity Framework

18
00:00:55.385 --> 00:00:57.380
plays a large part in this.

19
00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.950
The framework ensures the
protection and compliance of

20
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.040
customer tools and
personal work devices

21
00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:06.545
through the use of
security controls.

22
00:01:07.545 --> 00:01:10.130
Welcome to the world of security
frameworks and controls.

23
00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.300
Let's get started!
