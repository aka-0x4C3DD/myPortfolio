2
00:00:04.093 --> 00:00:05.358
My name is Wajih and

3
00:00:05.358 --> 00:00:10.825
I'm a security engineer at Google working
in the digital forensics department.

4
00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:13.521
Do you need a background in cybersecurity?

5
00:00:13.521 --> 00:00:14.380
No you don't.

6
00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:19.260
My past experiences is working at
a water park as a snow cone machine guy.

7
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.582
I worked at a movie theater selling
popcorn in concession stands.

8
00:00:23.582 --> 00:00:29.378
During my undergrad, I was a bio
major at first like my freshman year.

9
00:00:29.378 --> 00:00:33.441
I met someone in a bus who was
mentioning about this cool

10
00:00:33.441 --> 00:00:37.608
cybersecurity startup that
just sounded really cool.

11
00:00:37.608 --> 00:00:41.655
Some strategies I leveraged to
keep up to date on the latest

12
00:00:41.655 --> 00:00:46.117
cybersecurity trends is going on
online forums such as Medium to

13
00:00:46.117 --> 00:00:49.600
research different security trends and
topics.

14
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:54.477
I personally use Medium a lot
as I could filter by the tag of

15
00:00:54.477 --> 00:00:59.359
like I want to find articles
related to cybersecurity and

16
00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:03.952
or I want to find articles
related to cloud security.

17
00:01:03.952 --> 00:01:08.063
Based off their filtering algorithm,
I just go on and see like what other people

18
00:01:08.063 --> 00:01:11.598
are talking about and
then that's what helps me keep up to date.

19
00:01:11.598 --> 00:01:15.695
If it's more of like networking that
you're looking forward to,

20
00:01:15.695 --> 00:01:19.804
then I highly recommend just
going out to those like conferences.

21
00:01:19.804 --> 00:01:25.697
My advice for people wanting to get into
cybersecurity is don't be too overwhelmed

22
00:01:25.697 --> 00:01:31.440
with trying to understand every single
specialization within cybersecurity.

23
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:36.795
There's so much going on within the
cybersecurity field in terms of trends and

24
00:01:36.795 --> 00:01:40.037
it's nice to stay up to
date with all of those but

25
00:01:40.037 --> 00:01:44.578
sometimes you need to take a step back and
prioritize what subjects

26
00:01:44.578 --> 00:01:48.510
within cybersecurity you
are staying most up to date like on.

27
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:49.698
I love this job.

28
00:01:49.698 --> 00:01:51.340
I love the challenges.

29
00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:56.592
I feel like there is a shortage in
cybersecurity professionals out there from

30
00:01:56.592 --> 00:02:02.200
just past experiences, hearing from other
friends in computer science fields.

31
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.320
Most of them say that oh it's too hard,
too complicated to get in.

32
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.820
Don't listen to those people.

33
00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.080
I encourage you to push through.

34
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.642
It's definitely well worth it.

35
00:02:11.642 --> 00:02:15.261
First just get the fundamentals down and
be persistent.
