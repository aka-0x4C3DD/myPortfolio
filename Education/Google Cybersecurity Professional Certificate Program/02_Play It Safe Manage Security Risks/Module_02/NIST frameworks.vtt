00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:03.675
Welcome back. Before
we get started,

2
00:00:03.675 --> 00:00:06.000
let's quickly review the
purpose of frameworks.

3
00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:09.060
Organizations use frameworks as

4
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:12.840
a starting point to develop
plans that mitigate risks,

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.910
threats, and vulnerabilities to

6
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:16.980
sensitive data and assets.

7
00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:21.180
Fortunately, there are
organizations worldwide that

8
00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.850
create frameworks
security professionals

9
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.000
can use to develop those plans.

10
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
In this video, we'll
discuss two of

11
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.320
the National Institute of
Standards and Technology,

12
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.860
or NIST's frameworks
that can support

13
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:40.790
ongoing security efforts for
all types of organizations,

14
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:44.135
including for profit and
nonprofit businesses,

15
00:00:44.135 --> 00:00:46.675
as well as government agencies.

16
00:00:46.675 --> 00:00:50.210
While NIST is a US
based organization,

17
00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:53.390
the guidance it provides
can help analysts all over

18
00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.680
the world understand how to

19
00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.920
implement essential
cybersecurity practices.

20
00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.870
One NIST framework that we'll

21
00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:01.760
discuss throughout
the program is

22
00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.300
the NIST Cybersecurity
Framework, or CSF.

23
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:08.750
The CSF is a voluntary framework

24
00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.265
that consists of standards,

25
00:01:10.265 --> 00:01:12.230
guidelines, and best practices

26
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.365
to manage cybersecurity risk.

27
00:01:14.365 --> 00:01:17.770
This framework is widely
respected and essential for

28
00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.900
maintaining security
regardless of

29
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.850
the organization you work for.

30
00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.620
The CSF consists of

31
00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.235
five important core
functions, identify,

32
00:01:27.235 --> 00:01:32.125
protect, detect,
respond, and recover,

33
00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:35.245
which we'll discuss in
detail in a future video.

34
00:01:35.245 --> 00:01:37.030
For now, we'll focus on

35
00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.955
how the CSF benefits
organizations

36
00:01:39.955 --> 00:01:42.655
and how it can be used to
protect against threats,

37
00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:45.280
risks, and vulnerabilities by

38
00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.300
providing a workplace example.

39
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.300
Imagine that one
morning you receive

40
00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:51.010
a high-risk notification that

41
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:53.305
a workstation has
been compromised.

42
00:01:53.305 --> 00:01:56.245
You identify the workstation,

43
00:01:56.245 --> 00:01:57.770
and discover that there's

44
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.155
an unknown device
plugged into it.

45
00:02:00.155 --> 00:02:03.560
You block the unknown
device remotely to stop

46
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.010
any potential threat and
protect the organization.

47
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.100
Then you remove the
infected workstation

48
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.590
to prevent the spread
of the damage and use

49
00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:16.595
tools to detect any additional
threat actor behavior

50
00:02:16.595 --> 00:02:19.025
and identify the unknown device.

51
00:02:19.025 --> 00:02:21.860
You respond by investigating

52
00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.490
the incident to determine
who used the unknown device,

53
00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.200
how the threat occurred,

54
00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.100
what was affected, and where
the attack originated.

55
00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.240
In this case, you discover
that an employee was charging

56
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:36.740
their infected phone using

57
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.525
a USB port on their work laptop.

58
00:02:39.525 --> 00:02:42.100
Finally, you do your best to

59
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.890
recover any files or data that

60
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:47.440
were affected and
correct any damage

61
00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.000
the threat caused to
the workstation itself.

62
00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.785
As demonstrated by
the previous example,

63
00:02:53.785 --> 00:02:57.340
the core functions of
the NIST CSF provide

64
00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.020
specific guidance and

65
00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:01.360
direction for security
professionals.

66
00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.450
This framework is used to
develop plans to handle

67
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:08.425
an incident appropriately
and quickly to lower risk,

68
00:03:08.425 --> 00:03:11.230
protect an organization
against a threat,

69
00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:14.670
and mitigate any potential
vulnerabilities.

70
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.940
The NIST CSF also expands
into the protection of

71
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:21.610
the United States
federal government with

72
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:27.365
NIST special publication,
or SP 800-53.

73
00:03:27.365 --> 00:03:30.350
It provides a unified
framework for protecting

74
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:32.450
the security of
information systems

75
00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:33.950
within the federal government,

76
00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:36.290
including the
systems provided by

77
00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.095
private companies for
federal government use.

78
00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.450
The security
controls provided by

79
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.520
this framework are
used to maintain

80
00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.530
the CIA triad for those systems
used by the government.

81
00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:50.720
Isn't it amazing how all of

82
00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.105
these frameworks and
controls work together.

83
00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:56.150
We've discussed some really
important security topics

84
00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.380
in this video that will

85
00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:59.330
be very useful for you

86
00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.775
as you continue your
security journey.

87
00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:05.585
Because they're core elements
of the security profession,

88
00:04:05.585 --> 00:04:08.240
the NIST CSF is

89
00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:09.530
a useful framework that

90
00:04:09.530 --> 00:04:12.805
most security professionals
are familiar with,

91
00:04:12.805 --> 00:04:16.155
and having an
understanding of the NIST,

92
00:04:16.155 --> 00:04:19.820
SP 800-53 is crucial

93
00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.410
if you have an interest in

94
00:04:21.410 --> 00:04:24.080
working for the US
federal government.

95
00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:27.140
Coming up, we'll
continue to explore

96
00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.470
the five NIST CSF functions and

97
00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.980
how organizations use them
to protect assets and data.
