1
00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.510
It's important to
understand how to protect

2
00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:05.925
an organization's
data and assets

3
00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:07.140
because that will be part of

4
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.270
your role as a security analyst.

5
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:12.030
Fortunately, there
are principles and

6
00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.760
guidelines that can
be used, along with

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.670
NIST frameworks and
the CIA triad, to

8
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:21.180
help security teams
minimize threats and risks.

9
00:00:22.180 --> 00:00:24.885
In this video, we'll
explore some Open

10
00:00:24.885 --> 00:00:28.469
Web Application Security
Project, or OWASP,

11
00:00:28.469 --> 00:00:30.450
security principles that are

12
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.315
useful to know as an
entry-level analyst.

13
00:00:34.315 --> 00:00:35.850
The first OWASP principle is to

14
00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.785
minimize the attack
surface area.

15
00:00:38.785 --> 00:00:41.255
An attack surface refers to

16
00:00:41.255 --> 00:00:43.190
all the potential
vulnerabilities

17
00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.529
that a threat actor
could exploit,

18
00:00:45.529 --> 00:00:48.530
like attack vectors,
which are pathways

19
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:51.925
attackers use to penetrate
security defenses.

20
00:00:51.925 --> 00:00:54.530
Examples of common
attack vectors are

21
00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.485
phishing emails and
weak passwords.

22
00:00:57.485 --> 00:00:59.495
To minimize the attack surface

23
00:00:59.495 --> 00:01:01.790
and avoid incidents
from these types of

24
00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:06.245
vectors, security teams might
disable software features,

25
00:01:06.245 --> 00:01:09.680
restrict who can access
certain assets, or

26
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:13.660
establish more complex
password requirements.

27
00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.055
The principle of least privilege

28
00:01:16.055 --> 00:01:18.440
means making sure
that users have

29
00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.330
the least amount of access

30
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.735
required to perform
their everyday tasks.

31
00:01:23.735 --> 00:01:26.390
The main reason for
limiting access

32
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.610
to organizational
information and

33
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:31.070
resources is to
reduce the amount of

34
00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.195
damage a security
breach could cause.

35
00:01:34.195 --> 00:01:37.385
For example, as an
entry-level analyst,

36
00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:40.055
you may have access to log data,

37
00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:43.855
but may not have access to
change user permissions.

38
00:01:43.855 --> 00:01:45.320
Therefore, if

39
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.755
a threat actor compromises
your credentials,

40
00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:50.580
they'll only be able to gain

41
00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.945
limited access to digital
or physical assets,

42
00:01:53.945 --> 00:01:55.910
which may not be
enough for them to

43
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.720
deploy their intended attack.

44
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.610
The next principle we'll
discuss is defense in depth.

45
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.420
Defense in depth means that
an organization should have

46
00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:07.970
multiple security controls that

47
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.485
address risks and threats
in different ways.

48
00:02:11.485 --> 00:02:14.240
One example of a
security control is

49
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.870
multi-factor
authentication, or MFA,

50
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:19.670
which requires users to take

51
00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.710
an additional step beyond simply

52
00:02:21.710 --> 00:02:23.180
entering their username and

53
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:26.680
password to gain access
to an application.

54
00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.810
Other controls
include firewalls,

55
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.090
intrusion detection systems,

56
00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:34.640
and permission
settings that can be

57
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.495
used to create multiple
points of defense,

58
00:02:37.495 --> 00:02:39.080
a threat actor must get through

59
00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.760
to breach an organization.

60
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.760
Another principle is
separation of duties,

61
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.490
which can be used to
prevent individuals from

62
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.880
carrying out fraudulent
or illegal activities.

63
00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:53.030
This principle means that
no one should be given

64
00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.145
so many privileges that
they can misuse the system.

65
00:02:57.145 --> 00:03:01.100
For example, the person
in a company who signs

66
00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.200
the paychecks shouldn't also

67
00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.615
be the person who prepares them.

68
00:03:06.615 --> 00:03:09.745
Only two more principles
to go! You're doing great.

69
00:03:09.745 --> 00:03:12.020
Keep security simple is

70
00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.245
the next principle.
As the name suggests,

71
00:03:15.245 --> 00:03:17.945
when implementing
security controls,

72
00:03:17.945 --> 00:03:21.350
unnecessarily complicated
solutions should

73
00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.940
be avoided because they
can become unmanageable.

74
00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:28.385
The more complex the
security controls are,

75
00:03:28.385 --> 00:03:32.180
the harder it is for people
to work collaboratively.

76
00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.360
The last principle is to fix
security issues correctly.

77
00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:39.800
Technology is a great tool,

78
00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:42.395
but can also present challenges.

79
00:03:42.395 --> 00:03:44.825
When a security incident occurs,

80
00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.150
security professionals
are expected to

81
00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:50.045
identify the root cause quickly.

82
00:03:50.045 --> 00:03:52.910
From there, it's
important to correct

83
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:55.250
any identified
vulnerabilities and

84
00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:59.135
conduct tests to ensure that
repairs are successful.

85
00:04:00.135 --> 00:04:03.260
An example of an issue
is a weak password to

86
00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:05.690
access an organization's wifi

87
00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.925
because it could
lead to a breach.

88
00:04:07.925 --> 00:04:10.820
To fix this type
of security issue,

89
00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.285
stricter password policies
could be put in place.

90
00:04:15.285 --> 00:04:16.535
I know we've covered a lot,

91
00:04:16.535 --> 00:04:19.250
but understanding these
principles increases

92
00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:21.395
your overall security knowledge

93
00:04:21.395 --> 00:04:25.650
and can help you stand out
as a security professional.
