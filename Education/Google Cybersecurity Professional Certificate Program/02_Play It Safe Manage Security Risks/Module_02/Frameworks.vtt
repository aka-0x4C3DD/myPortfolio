00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.530
In an organization, plans
are put in place to protect

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.595
against a variety of threats,
risks, and vulnerabilities.

3
00:00:08.595 --> 00:00:11.385
However, the requirements
used to protect

4
00:00:11.385 --> 00:00:14.655
organizations and
people often overlap.

5
00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:18.750
Because of this, organizations
use security frameworks as

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:20.160
a starting point to create

7
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.115
their own security
policies and processes.

8
00:00:24.115 --> 00:00:26.595
Let's start by quickly
reviewing what frameworks are.

9
00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:30.230
Security frameworks are
guidelines used for building

10
00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.240
plans to help mitigate risks and

11
00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:34.625
threats to data and privacy,

12
00:00:34.625 --> 00:00:37.880
such as social engineering
attacks and ransomware.

13
00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:41.285
Security involves more than
just the virtual space.

14
00:00:41.285 --> 00:00:42.980
It also includes the physical,

15
00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.440
which is why many
organizations have

16
00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:48.355
plans to maintain safety
in the work environment.

17
00:00:48.355 --> 00:00:50.720
For example, access
to a building

18
00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.270
may require using a
key card or badge.

19
00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.280
Other security
frameworks provide

20
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.824
guidance for how to prevent,

21
00:00:56.824 --> 00:00:59.860
detect, and respond
to security breaches.

22
00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.850
This is particularly important

23
00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.010
when trying to protect
an organization from

24
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:06.080
social engineering attacks like

25
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.720
phishing that target
their employees.

26
00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.850
Remember, people are the
biggest threat to security.

27
00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:17.450
So frameworks can be used to
create plans that increase

28
00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.760
employee awareness and
educate them about

29
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.250
how they can protect
the organization,

30
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.365
their co-workers,
and themselves.

31
00:01:24.365 --> 00:01:27.800
Educating employees about
existing security challenges is

32
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.099
essential for minimizing the
possibility of a breach.

33
00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:33.200
Providing employee
training about how to

34
00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.960
recognize red flags, or
potential threats, is

35
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.870
essential, along with
having plans in place

36
00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:42.335
to quickly report and
address security issues.

37
00:01:42.335 --> 00:01:44.300
As an analyst, it will be

38
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.325
important for you
to understand and

39
00:01:46.325 --> 00:01:48.530
implement the plans
your organization

40
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.110
has in place to keep
the organization,

41
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.510
its employees, and
the people it

42
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.015
serves safe from social
engineering attacks,

43
00:01:56.015 --> 00:01:59.450
breaches, and other harmful
security incidents.

44
00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:01.550
Coming up, we'll review and

45
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:04.010
discuss security
controls, which are used

46
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:06.260
alongside frameworks to achieve

47
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:09.330
an organization's
security goals.
