00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:02.910
Great job! Now you've had

2
00:00:02.910 --> 00:00:05.100
an opportunity to
learn more about

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.840
security concepts that can help

4
00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.960
an organization protect
data and assets.

5
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.670
We've covered quite a bit,

6
00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:14.760
but it will all be valuable
knowledge for you as you

7
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:18.525
continue along your journey
into the security profession.

8
00:00:19.525 --> 00:00:22.200
We started by defining what
security frameworks are,

9
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.210
and how they help organizations

10
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.550
protect critical information.

11
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.519
We also explored
security controls

12
00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.750
and the important role they

13
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.220
play in protecting against

14
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.490
risks, threats, and
vulnerabilities.

15
00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:39.265
This included a discussion
of the CIA triad,

16
00:00:39.265 --> 00:00:43.940
which is a core security model,
and two NIST frameworks:

17
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.670
the CSF and S.P. 800-53.

18
00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:53.385
Then, we covered some of OWASP's
secure design principles.

19
00:00:54.385 --> 00:00:57.860
We ended by introducing
security audits with a focus on

20
00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:00.530
the elements of an
internal audit that you

21
00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.040
may be asked to complete
or contribute to.

22
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.490
Security professionals use
the concepts we discussed

23
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:10.640
to help protect
organizations' assets,

24
00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.300
data, systems, and people.

25
00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:15.770
As you continue along

26
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.200
your journey into the
security profession,

27
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.455
a lot of these concepts
will come up repeatedly.

28
00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:23.600
What we're doing
now is giving you

29
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.580
a foundational understanding of

30
00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.769
security practices and topics

31
00:01:27.769 --> 00:01:30.040
that will help you
along the way.

32
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.180
In the next section
of the course,

33
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.610
we'll discuss specific
security tools

34
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.510
you may one day
use as an analyst.

35
00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:39.950
We'll cover how they're
used to improve

36
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.320
an organization's
security posture

37
00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.960
and how they can help
you achieve your goal of

38
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.870
keeping organizations
and people safe.

39
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.460
I'm excited to continue

40
00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.530
this journey with
you. See you soon!
