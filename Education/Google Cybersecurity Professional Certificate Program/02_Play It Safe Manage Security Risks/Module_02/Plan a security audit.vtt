00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.105
Now that we've covered
different frameworks,

2
00:00:03.105 --> 00:00:05.475
controls, security principles,

3
00:00:05.475 --> 00:00:08.715
and compliance regulations,
the question is:

4
00:00:08.715 --> 00:00:10.770
How do they all work together?

5
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:12.750
The answer to that question is

6
00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.850
by conducting security audits.

7
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.190
A security audit is a review of

8
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:19.695
an organization's
security controls,

9
00:00:19.695 --> 00:00:24.375
policies, and procedures
against a set of expectations.

10
00:00:25.375 --> 00:00:26.520
There are two main types of

11
00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.880
security audits:
external and internal.

12
00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.030
We'll focus on internal
security audits

13
00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:34.470
because those are the types

14
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:36.840
of audits that
entry-level analysts

15
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.375
might be asked to contribute to.

16
00:00:40.375 --> 00:00:41.690
An internal security audit is

17
00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.790
typically conducted by a team of

18
00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:45.620
people that might include

19
00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.005
an organization's
compliance officer,

20
00:00:48.005 --> 00:00:52.250
security manager, and other
security team members.

21
00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.790
Internal security audits
are used to help improve

22
00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.540
an organization's security
posture and help organizations

23
00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:00.965
avoid fines from governing

24
00:01:00.965 --> 00:01:03.920
agencies due to a
lack of compliance.

25
00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.290
Internal security audits help

26
00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:09.920
security teams identify
organizational risk,

27
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.720
assess controls, and
correct compliance issues.

28
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.240
Now that we've discussed the
purposes of internal audits,

29
00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.930
let's cover some common
elements of internal audits.

30
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.665
These include
establishing the scope

31
00:01:23.665 --> 00:01:25.090
and goals of the audit,

32
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.935
conducting a risk assessment

33
00:01:26.935 --> 00:01:29.185
of the organization's assets,

34
00:01:29.185 --> 00:01:31.810
completing a
controls assessment,

35
00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.595
assessing compliance,

36
00:01:33.595 --> 00:01:36.825
and communicating
results to stakeholders.

37
00:01:37.825 --> 00:01:38.770
In this video, we'll cover

38
00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.600
the first two elements, which are

39
00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.150
a part of the audit
planning process:

40
00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:45.745
establishing the
scope and goals,

41
00:01:45.745 --> 00:01:48.175
then completing a
risk assessment.

42
00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:51.370
Scope refers to the
specific criteria

43
00:01:51.370 --> 00:01:53.335
of an internal security audit.

44
00:01:53.335 --> 00:01:58.240
Scope requires organizations
to identify people, assets,

45
00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.400
policies, procedures,

46
00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.200
and technologies that might

47
00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:05.005
impact an organization's
security posture.

48
00:02:05.005 --> 00:02:07.300
Goals are an outline of

49
00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.535
the organization's
security objectives,

50
00:02:09.535 --> 00:02:11.695
or what they want to achieve

51
00:02:11.695 --> 00:02:14.290
in order to improve
their security posture.

52
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.410
Although more senior-level
security team members and

53
00:02:17.410 --> 00:02:19.510
other stakeholders
usually establish

54
00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:21.635
the scope and goals
of the audit,

55
00:02:21.635 --> 00:02:23.710
entry-level analysts might be

56
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.750
asked to review and understand

57
00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:27.880
the scope and goals in order to

58
00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.515
complete other
elements of the audit.

59
00:02:31.515 --> 00:02:33.520
As an example, the scope of

60
00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.255
this audit involves
assessing user permissions;

61
00:02:37.255 --> 00:02:41.200
identifying existing
controls, policies,

62
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.230
and procedures;
and accounting for

63
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.925
the technology currently in
use by the organization.

64
00:02:47.925 --> 00:02:50.360
The goals outlined include

65
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:53.015
implementing core
functions of frameworks,

66
00:02:53.015 --> 00:02:54.785
like the NIST CSF;

67
00:02:54.785 --> 00:02:58.100
establishing policies
and procedures to ensure

68
00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.945
compliance; and strengthening
system controls.

69
00:03:02.945 --> 00:03:05.270
The next element is
conducting a risk assessment,

70
00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:07.580
which is focused on identifying

71
00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.515
potential threats, risks,
and vulnerabilities.

72
00:03:11.515 --> 00:03:14.225
This helps
organizations consider

73
00:03:14.225 --> 00:03:15.920
what security measures should

74
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.750
be implemented and monitored

75
00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.375
to ensure the safety of assets.

76
00:03:20.375 --> 00:03:23.420
Similar to establishing
the scope and goals,

77
00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.850
a risk assessment is oftentimes

78
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.835
completed by managers
or other stakeholders.

79
00:03:28.835 --> 00:03:31.490
However, you might
be asked to analyze

80
00:03:31.490 --> 00:03:34.160
details provided in
the risk assessment

81
00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.840
to consider what types of

82
00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.480
controls and
compliance regulations

83
00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:40.460
need to be in place to help

84
00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:43.270
improve the organization's
security posture.

85
00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:46.280
For example, this
risk assessment

86
00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:49.010
highlights that there
are inadequate controls,

87
00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.230
processes, and procedures in

88
00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:54.380
place to protect the
organization's assets.

89
00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.040
Specifically, there is a
lack of proper management of

90
00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:00.065
physical and digital assets,

91
00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:02.335
including employee equipment.

92
00:04:02.335 --> 00:04:03.980
The equipment used to

93
00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.860
store data is not
properly secured.

94
00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:09.980
And access to private
information stored in

95
00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.305
the organization's
internal network

96
00:04:12.305 --> 00:04:15.580
likely needs more robust
controls in place.

97
00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.910
Now that we've discussed

98
00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:18.725
the initial planning elements

99
00:04:18.725 --> 00:04:20.720
of an internal security audit,

100
00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.450
coming up, we'll focus on
the last three elements.
