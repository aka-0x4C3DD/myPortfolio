00:00:01.334 --> 00:00:06.128
Previously, we discussed the initial
planning elements of an internal

2
00:00:06.128 --> 00:00:07.353
security audit.

3
00:00:07.353 --> 00:00:12.309
In this video, we'll cover the final
elements that an entry-level analyst

4
00:00:12.309 --> 00:00:14.332
might be asked to complete.

5
00:00:15.332 --> 00:00:19.644
As a reminder, the planning elements
of internal security audits include

6
00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:24.788
establishing the scope and
goals, then conducting a risk assessment.

7
00:00:24.788 --> 00:00:29.722
The remaining elements are completing
a controls assessment,

8
00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:33.751
assessing compliance, and
communicating results.

9
00:00:33.751 --> 00:00:39.111
Before completing these last three
elements, you'll need to review the scope and goals,

10
00:00:39.111 --> 00:00:44.083
as well as the risk assessment,
and ask yourself some questions.

11
00:00:44.083 --> 00:00:51.933
For example: What is the audit meant to achieve?
Which assets are most at risk?

12
00:00:51.933 --> 00:00:56.210
Are current controls sufficient
to protect those assets?

13
00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:02.524
If not, what controls and compliance
regulations need to be implemented?

14
00:01:02.524 --> 00:01:06.716
Considering questions like
these can support your ability

15
00:01:06.716 --> 00:01:10.500
to complete the next element:
a controls assessment.

16
00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.906
A controls assessment involves
closely reviewing an organization's existing

17
00:01:15.906 --> 00:01:20.859
assets, then evaluating
potential risks to those assets,

18
00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:25.372
to ensure internal controls and
processes are effective.

19
00:01:25.372 --> 00:01:30.113
To do this, entry-level analysts
might be tasked with classifying

20
00:01:30.113 --> 00:01:35.384
controls into the following categories:
administrative controls,

21
00:01:35.384 --> 00:01:38.739
technical controls, and physical controls.

22
00:01:39.739 --> 00:01:44.203
Administrative controls are related to
the human component of cybersecurity.

23
00:01:44.203 --> 00:01:49.222
They include policies and
procedures that define how an organization

24
00:01:49.222 --> 00:01:54.443
manages data, such as the implementation
of password policies.

25
00:01:55.443 --> 00:02:01.221
Technical controls are hardware and software solutions
used to protect assets, such

26
00:02:01.221 --> 00:02:07.110
as the use of intrusion detection
systems, or IDS's, and encryption.

27
00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.388
Physical controls refer to measures
put in place to prevent physical

28
00:02:12.388 --> 00:02:17.678
access to protected assets, such as
surveillance cameras and locks.

29
00:02:18.678 --> 00:02:20.783
The next element is determining whether or

30
00:02:20.783 --> 00:02:26.139
not the organization is adhering to
necessary compliance regulations.

31
00:02:26.139 --> 00:02:30.310
As a reminder,
compliance regulations are laws that

32
00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.602
organizations must follow to ensure
private data remains secure.

33
00:02:35.602 --> 00:02:41.205
In this example, the organization conducts
business in the European Union and

34
00:02:41.205 --> 00:02:43.473
accepts credit card payments.

35
00:02:43.473 --> 00:02:47.437
So they need to adhere to the GDPR and

36
00:02:47.437 --> 00:02:53.924
Payment Card Industry Data
Security Standard, or PCI DSS.

37
00:02:54.924 --> 00:02:59.232
The final common element of an internal
security audit is communication.

38
00:02:59.232 --> 00:03:03.491
Once the internal security
audit is complete, results and

39
00:03:03.491 --> 00:03:08.026
recommendations need to be
communicated to stakeholders.

40
00:03:08.026 --> 00:03:13.045
In general, this type of communication
summarizes the scope and

41
00:03:13.045 --> 00:03:14.603
goals of the audit.

42
00:03:14.603 --> 00:03:21.725
Then, it lists existing risks and notes how
quickly those risks need to be addressed.

43
00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:25.918
Additionally, it identifies
compliance regulations

44
00:03:25.918 --> 00:03:30.757
the organization needs to adhere to and
provides recommendations for

45
00:03:30.757 --> 00:03:34.371
improving the organization's
security posture.

46
00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:40.292
Internal audits are a great way to
identify gaps within an organization.

47
00:03:40.292 --> 00:03:45.498
When I worked at a previous company,
my team and I conducted an internal

48
00:03:45.498 --> 00:03:50.270
password audit and found that
many of the passwords were weak.

49
00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:55.432
Once we identified this issue,
the compliance team took the lead and

50
00:03:55.432 --> 00:03:58.997
began enforcing stricter
password policies.

51
00:03:58.997 --> 00:04:03.757
Audits are an opportunity to
determine what security measures an

52
00:04:03.757 --> 00:04:08.177
organization has in place and
what areas need to be improved to

53
00:04:08.177 --> 00:04:12.343
achieve the organization's
desired security posture.

54
00:04:13.343 --> 00:04:18.544
Security audits are quite involved, yet
of extreme value to organizations.

55
00:04:18.544 --> 00:04:19.905
Later in the course,

56
00:04:19.905 --> 00:04:25.197
you'll have an opportunity to complete
elements of an internal security audit for

57
00:04:25.197 --> 00:04:30.051
a fictional company, which you can
include in your professional portfolio.
