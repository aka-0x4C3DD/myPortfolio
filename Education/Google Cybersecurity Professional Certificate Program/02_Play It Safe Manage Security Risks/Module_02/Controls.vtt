00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.460
While frameworks
are used to create

2
00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.590
plans to address security risks,

3
00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:07.525
threats, and vulnerabilities,

4
00:00:07.525 --> 00:00:11.870
controls are used to
reduce specific risks.

5
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:14.460
If proper controls
are not in place,

6
00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.220
an organization could face
significant financial impacts

7
00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.275
and damage to their reputation

8
00:00:20.275 --> 00:00:22.225
because of exposure to risks

9
00:00:22.225 --> 00:00:25.855
including trespassing, creating
fake employee accounts,

10
00:00:25.855 --> 00:00:27.950
or providing free benefits.

11
00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.900
Let's review the
definition of controls.

12
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.550
Security controls are safeguards

13
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.000
designed to reduce
specific security risks.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.540
In this video, we'll
discuss three common types

15
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.660
of controls: encryption,

16
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.660
authentication,
and authorization.

17
00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:48.350
Encryption is the process
of converting data

18
00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.550
from a readable format
to an encoded format.

19
00:00:51.550 --> 00:00:54.620
Typically, encryption
involves converting

20
00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.770
data from plaintext
to ciphertext.

21
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.085
Ciphertext is the
raw, encoded message

22
00:01:01.085 --> 00:01:04.510
that's unreadable to
humans and computers.

23
00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:07.460
Ciphertext data cannot
be read until it's

24
00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.015
been decrypted into its
original plaintext form.

25
00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:12.950
Encryption is used to ensure

26
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.230
confidentiality of
sensitive data,

27
00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.510
such as customers'
account information

28
00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:19.790
or social security numbers.

29
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:22.430
Another control that
can be used to protect

30
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.070
sensitive data is
authentication.

31
00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:27.500
Authentication is the process of

32
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.775
verifying who someone
or something is.

33
00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:34.010
A real-world example
of authentication is

34
00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:37.630
logging into a website with
your username and password.

35
00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:41.435
This basic form of
authentication proves that you

36
00:01:41.435 --> 00:01:43.670
know the username and password

37
00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.699
and should be allowed
to access the website.

38
00:01:46.699 --> 00:01:49.850
More advanced methods
of authentication,

39
00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.185
such as multi-factor
authentication, or MFA,

40
00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:55.640
challenge the user to

41
00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.970
demonstrate that they
are who they claim to be

42
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:01.070
by requiring both a password

43
00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:04.175
and an additional form
of authentication,

44
00:02:04.175 --> 00:02:07.100
like a security
code or biometrics,

45
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:08.180
such as a fingerprint,

46
00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.100
voice, or face scan.

47
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.400
Biometrics are unique
physical characteristics

48
00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:16.579
that can be used to verify
a person's identity.

49
00:02:16.579 --> 00:02:20.125
Examples of biometrics
are a fingerprint,

50
00:02:20.125 --> 00:02:22.730
an eye scan, or a palm scan.

51
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.820
One example of a social
engineering attack

52
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.865
that can exploit
biometrics is vishing.

53
00:02:28.865 --> 00:02:31.070
Vishing is the exploitation of

54
00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:33.380
electronic voice
communication to

55
00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.840
obtain sensitive information or

56
00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.065
to impersonate a known source.

57
00:02:38.065 --> 00:02:41.570
For example, vishing could
be used to impersonate

58
00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.890
a person's voice to steal

59
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.705
their identity and
then commit a crime.

60
00:02:46.705 --> 00:02:50.845
Another very important security
control is authorization.

61
00:02:50.845 --> 00:02:53.870
Authorization refers
to the concept of

62
00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:58.055
granting access to specific
resources within a system.

63
00:02:58.055 --> 00:03:01.715
Essentially, authorization
is used to verify

64
00:03:01.715 --> 00:03:05.705
that a person has permission
to access a resource.

65
00:03:05.705 --> 00:03:08.660
As an example, if
you're working as

66
00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.400
an entry-level security analyst

67
00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.990
for the federal government,

68
00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:14.270
you could have
permission to access

69
00:03:14.270 --> 00:03:16.445
data through the deep web or

70
00:03:16.445 --> 00:03:18.530
other internal data that is only

71
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.460
accessible if you're
a federal employee.

72
00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:23.870
The security controls
we discussed

73
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:26.120
today are only one element of

74
00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.610
a core security model
known as the CIA triad.

75
00:03:30.610 --> 00:03:33.620
Coming up, we'll talk more
about this model and how

76
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:37.680
security teams use it to
protect their organizations.
