[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.025 --> 00:00:08.176
Hi, I'm Dion.
I am a program manager at Google.

3
00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:13.707
I am a part of the detection and response
team which falls under the privacy,

4
00:00:13.707 --> 00:00:16.568
safety, and security organization.

5
00:00:16.568 --> 00:00:21.328
My favorite part of my job is
understanding that there are threats

6
00:00:21.328 --> 00:00:23.498
that we encounter day by day.

7
00:00:23.498 --> 00:00:26.950
And my team helps to ensure that
we can find those threats and

8
00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.756
respond to them accordingly.

9
00:00:28.756 --> 00:00:31.672
Cybersecurity is very important.

10
00:00:31.672 --> 00:00:35.460
Just as we need to keep
ourselves physically secure,

11
00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.426
we need to keep our information
online safe and secure.

12
00:00:39.426 --> 00:00:43.777
So, whenever you use a computer or a device,

13
00:00:43.777 --> 00:00:47.192
that data lives somewhere online.

14
00:00:47.192 --> 00:00:48.672
And you trust Google and

15
00:00:48.672 --> 00:00:52.901
other companies to secure that data and
keep it private, only to you.

16
00:00:52.901 --> 00:00:58.050
The work that I do day by day ensures
that your information, your data, and

17
00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:03.314
the world's information stays secure,
stays private, and protected.

18
00:01:03.314 --> 00:01:09.625
I've held many jobs in different areas
before getting involved in cybersecurity.

19
00:01:09.625 --> 00:01:13.497
One of those jobs is
serving as a radio DJ and

20
00:01:13.497 --> 00:01:19.103
online personality,
which has not much to do with security.

21
00:01:19.103 --> 00:01:24.626
One of the key things I got from
that was to keep the music playing.

22
00:01:24.626 --> 00:01:28.852
No matter what happens,
keep the music playing.

23
00:01:28.852 --> 00:01:33.152
I'm also a proud father.
My kids are my greatest assets and

24
00:01:33.152 --> 00:01:34.880
I have to protect them.

25
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.079
There are lots of threats and
risks associated with them,

26
00:01:39.079 --> 00:01:44.414
even vulnerabilities. As a security guy,
I have to protect the information

27
00:01:44.414 --> 00:01:49.932
that I'm tasked with holding from threats,
risks, and vulnerabilities.

28
00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:53.570
As a security professional,
fires will come up.

29
00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.645
You have to find a way to keep
things moving, either escalating

30
00:01:58.645 --> 00:02:03.928
to the right team or escalating up
the chain to find a resolution.

31
00:02:03.928 --> 00:02:07.626
So, having not been formally
trained in security,

32
00:02:07.626 --> 00:02:11.247
I am tasked with teaching
myself new things daily.

33
00:02:11.247 --> 00:02:14.965
New threats arrive,
new things need to be protected, and

34
00:02:14.965 --> 00:02:17.349
security is constantly changing.

35
00:02:17.349 --> 00:02:20.214
I teach myself through online learning.

36
00:02:20.214 --> 00:02:24.980
I subscribe to and read to lots of
journals related to security knowledge,

37
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.713
and I'm also taking some
security courses online as well.

38
00:02:28.713 --> 00:02:32.925
I think the most challenging
part about an entry-level role

39
00:02:32.925 --> 00:02:36.319
in security is not knowing
what you don't know.

40
00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:40.712
When I first got involved in security,
I was really winging it, but

41
00:02:40.712 --> 00:02:45.042
the one thing that I did was always
reach out to my team for support.

42
00:02:45.042 --> 00:02:49.692
Getting stuck is a part of the process,
we could always lean on our team and

43
00:02:49.692 --> 00:02:53.297
others for additional support or
to help us get unstuck.
