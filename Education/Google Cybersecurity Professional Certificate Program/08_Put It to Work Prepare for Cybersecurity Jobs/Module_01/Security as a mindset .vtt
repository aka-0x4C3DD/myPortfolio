00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.000
Let's take a little
time to discuss

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.320
a concept that would help you

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.210
throughout your security career:

4
00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.445
having a security mindset.

5
00:00:09.445 --> 00:00:12.735
In previous courses, we discussed
various threats, risks,

6
00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:15.555
and vulnerabilities and
how they can impact

7
00:00:15.555 --> 00:00:18.150
organizational operations
and the people

8
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.160
served by those organizations.

9
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.800
These concepts are
key considerations

10
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.390
when thinking about having
a security mindset.

11
00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.519
You'll have to recognize not
only what you're defending,

12
00:00:28.519 --> 00:00:31.345
but what or who you're
defending against.

13
00:00:32.345 --> 00:00:33.380
For example, it's important to

14
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.630
recognize the types
of assets that are

15
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:36.770
essential to maintaining

16
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:38.825
an organization's
business functions,

17
00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:41.135
along with types of threats,

18
00:00:41.135 --> 00:00:43.070
risks, and vulnerabilities that

19
00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.455
can negatively
impact those assets.

20
00:00:45.455 --> 00:00:48.845
And that's what having a security
mindset is all about.

21
00:00:48.845 --> 00:00:51.380
A security mindset
is the ability

22
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:53.510
to evaluate risk and constantly

23
00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.920
seek out and identify

24
00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.235
the potential or actual
breach of a system,

25
00:00:58.235 --> 00:01:00.235
application, or data.

26
00:01:01.235 --> 00:01:01.820
Earlier in the program,

27
00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.950
we discussed threats, risks,

28
00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:05.930
and vulnerabilities
that are posed by

29
00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.025
social engineering
attacks, such as phishing.

30
00:01:09.025 --> 00:01:11.390
These attacks are
designed to compromise

31
00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:13.910
an organization's assets to help

32
00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.545
the threat actor or actors gain

33
00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:17.825
access to sensitive information.

34
00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:19.940
Using our security mindset can

35
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.250
help prevent these
types of attacks.

36
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.905
It's important that
we're constantly staying

37
00:01:24.905 --> 00:01:27.980
up-to-date with the kinds of attacks
that are happening.

38
00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.355
To do this, it's good to develop
a habit of seeking out

39
00:01:31.355 --> 00:01:32.810
information regarding

40
00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:35.855
the latest security threats
or vulnerabilities.

41
00:01:35.855 --> 00:01:38.210
As you do this, new ideas for

42
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.880
protecting company
data may come to mind.

43
00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.190
Security is an
everyday objective

44
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.610
for every security
team in the industry.

45
00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:48.050
So having a security
mindset helps analysts

46
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.675
defend against the constant
pressure from attackers.

47
00:01:50.675 --> 00:01:53.030
That mindset can make
you think: "Every click of

48
00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:56.240
the mouse has the potential
to lead to a security breach."

49
00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.870
That level of scrutiny as
a security professional

50
00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:00.950
helps you prepare for

51
00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:04.205
the worst-case scenario,
even if it doesn't happen.

52
00:02:05.205 --> 00:02:07.655
Entry-level analysts can help
protect low-level assets,

53
00:02:07.655 --> 00:02:10.910
such as an organization's
guest WiFi network, and

54
00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:14.480
high-importance assets, such
as intellectual property,

55
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:19.205
trade secrets, PII, and
even financial information.

56
00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:21.590
Your security mindset
allows you to

57
00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.930
protect all levels of assets.

58
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.810
However, if an
incident does occur,

59
00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:28.565
that doesn't mean you respond to

60
00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:30.620
all incidents in the same way.

61
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.050
So we'll discuss incident
prioritization

62
00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:34.670
a little later in the course.

63
00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:36.740
Having a strong security mindset

64
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.225
can help set you apart from

65
00:02:38.225 --> 00:02:39.860
other candidates as you

66
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.470
prepare to enter the
security profession.

67
00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.660
It may even be a good idea to

68
00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:47.930
reference that foundation
in future job interviews.

69
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.790
We'll discuss
interview preparation

70
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:51.920
in detail, later in the course.

71
00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.810
Coming up, we'll focus on

72
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:57.030
incident detection
in greater detail.
