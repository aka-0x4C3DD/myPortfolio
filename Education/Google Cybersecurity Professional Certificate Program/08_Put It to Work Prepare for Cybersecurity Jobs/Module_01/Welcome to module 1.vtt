Welcome to the first
section of the course!

2
00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.715
In the next several videos,

3
00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:09.030
we'll discuss what it means
to have a security mindset,

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:11.220
and how you'll use
that mindset to

5
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.235
protect an organization's
assets and data.

6
00:00:14.235 --> 00:00:16.680
Then, we'll explore
the process of

7
00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.545
incident escalation in
the event of a breach.

8
00:00:19.545 --> 00:00:21.270
Finally, we'll share

9
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:23.880
information to better
help you understand

10
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.140
the sensitive nature of

11
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.180
the data that you'll
work to protect.

12
00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:29.280
Coming up, we'll focus on

13
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:31.410
how to develop a
security mindset

14
00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:34.800
then use that mindset to
protect organizations

15
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:37.060
and the people they serve.
