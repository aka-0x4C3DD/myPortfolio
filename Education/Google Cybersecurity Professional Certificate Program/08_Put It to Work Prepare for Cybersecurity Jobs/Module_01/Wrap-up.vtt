You've had an opportunity to learn
more about the important role an

2
00:00:05.335 --> 00:00:10.502
entry-level analyst plays in protecting
the data and assets of an organization.

3
00:00:10.502 --> 00:00:12.928
Let's quickly review what we covered.

4
00:00:13.928 --> 00:00:17.291
We started off by discussing the
importance of having a security mindset,

5
00:00:17.291 --> 00:00:20.150
including how it supports
incident detection.

6
00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:24.779
Then, we examined the relationship
between incidents and events, and

7
00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.239
further explored the incident
escalation process.

8
00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:32.797
We ended our discussion by exploring the
sensitive nature of the data that you're

9
00:00:32.797 --> 00:00:33.788
protecting and

10
00:00:33.788 --> 00:00:39.150
the amount of people counting on you to
play your part in protecting that data.

11
00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.108
Understanding how valuable you are as
a member of the security team can help

12
00:00:44.108 --> 00:00:46.874
you put the work you do into perspective.

13
00:00:46.874 --> 00:00:49.167
Every role in security matters.

14
00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:54.380
Each individual contributes to making
a company's operations flow smoothly.

15
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.540
I hope you enjoyed our
discussion as much as I did!
