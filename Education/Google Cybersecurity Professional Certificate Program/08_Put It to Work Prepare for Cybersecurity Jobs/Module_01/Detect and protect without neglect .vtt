00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.020
Welcome back! In
earlier courses,

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:05.280
we discussed the impact that

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.020
security incidents can have on

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:10.605
the critical data and
assets of an organization.

5
00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:13.230
If data and assets
are compromised,

6
00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.470
it can lead to financial
pains for an organization.

7
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.920
It can even lead to regulatory
fines and the loss of

8
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:21.840
credibility with customers or

9
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.135
other businesses in
the same industry.

10
00:00:24.135 --> 00:00:26.550
This is why your
role in protecting

11
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.205
company data and
assets is so valuable.

12
00:00:30.205 --> 00:00:31.320
Collaboration is
an exciting part

13
00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:32.865
about working in security.

14
00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:34.830
There are so many
individuals across

15
00:00:34.830 --> 00:00:36.270
an organization that are

16
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.815
interested in various
functions of security.

17
00:00:38.815 --> 00:00:41.690
No security professional
can do this alone.

18
00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:43.310
Some team members are focused on

19
00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:45.910
protecting sensitive
financial data,

20
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.085
others work on protecting
usernames and passwords,

21
00:00:49.085 --> 00:00:51.020
some are more focused
on protecting

22
00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.210
third-party vendor security, and

23
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:57.305
others may be concerned with
protecting employees' PII.

24
00:00:58.305 --> 00:00:59.810
These stakeholders
and others have

25
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.420
an interest in the role the
security team plays for

26
00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.760
keeping the organization,
and the people

27
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.640
it serves, safe from
malicious attacks.

28
00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.790
It's important to recognize
that the assets and data you

29
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:14.735
protect affect multiple
levels of your organization.

30
00:01:15.735 --> 00:01:17.180
One of the most
important concerns for

31
00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.900
an organization is the
protection of customer data.

32
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:23.720
Customers trust that an
organization they engage

33
00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:26.750
with will protect their
data at all times.

34
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.985
This means credit card numbers,

35
00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:31.670
Social Security numbers, emails,

36
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:34.895
usernames, passwords,
and so much more.

37
00:01:35.895 --> 00:01:36.830
It's important to keep this in

38
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:39.815
mind when taking on
a security role.

39
00:01:39.815 --> 00:01:41.660
Understanding the importance of

40
00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.995
the data you're protecting

41
00:01:42.995 --> 00:01:46.565
is a big part of having a
strong security mindset.

42
00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:48.560
As a security professional,

43
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.030
it's important to handle

44
00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.000
sensitive data with
care while being

45
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.220
mindful of the little details to

46
00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.325
ensure that private data is
protected from breaches.

47
00:01:59.325 --> 00:02:01.325
When a security event
results in a data breach,

48
00:02:01.325 --> 00:02:04.375
it is categorized as
a security incident.

49
00:02:04.375 --> 00:02:06.350
However, if the event is

50
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.480
resolved without
resulting in a breach,

51
00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.610
it's not considered an incident.

52
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.950
It's better to be
safe when it comes

53
00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.290
to taking a job in the
security profession.

54
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:17.480
That means paying attention to

55
00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:20.585
details and raising your
issues to your supervisor.

56
00:02:20.585 --> 00:02:24.170
For example, a
seemingly small issue,

57
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.060
like an employee
installing an app on

58
00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:28.400
their work device without
getting permission from

59
00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.729
the help desk should be
escalated to a supervisor.

60
00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:34.670
This is because some apps
have vulnerabilities that

61
00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.805
can pose a threat to the
security of the organization.

62
00:02:38.805 --> 00:02:40.460
An example of a bigger issue is

63
00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:41.960
noticing that a log may have

64
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:44.025
malicious code executed in it.

65
00:02:44.025 --> 00:02:47.155
Malicious code can lead
to operational downtime,

66
00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:49.390
severe financial consequences,

67
00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.390
or the loss of critical
high-level assets.

68
00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:54.370
The point is that there are

69
00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:57.715
no issues that are
too small or too big.

70
00:02:57.715 --> 00:02:59.170
If you're not sure of the

71
00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:01.090
potential impact of an incident,

72
00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:03.100
it's always best
to be cautious and

73
00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:05.740
report events to the
appropriate team members.

74
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.195
Each day on the job as
a security professional

75
00:03:08.195 --> 00:03:10.900
comes with a level
of responsibility to

76
00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:13.975
help protect the organization
and the people it serves.

77
00:03:13.975 --> 00:03:17.455
The decisions you make not
only affect the company,

78
00:03:17.455 --> 00:03:19.150
but also its customers and

79
00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:21.925
countless team members
across the organization.

80
00:03:21.925 --> 00:03:26.000
Remember, what you do matters!
