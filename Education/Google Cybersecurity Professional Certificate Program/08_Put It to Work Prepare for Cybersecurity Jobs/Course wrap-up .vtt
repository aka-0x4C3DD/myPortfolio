00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:05.650
Congratulations on completing the final
course of the certificate program!

2
00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.970
We covered a lot of information,

3
00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:09.890
so let's take a moment to review.

4
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:13.009
We started by discussing
how to protect assets and

5
00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:16.734
communicate incidents by
developing a security mindset.

6
00:00:17.734 --> 00:00:21.360
Then, we covered when and how to escalate
incidents to the appropriate team

7
00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:25.688
members to make sure that small
issues don't become big problems for

8
00:00:25.688 --> 00:00:28.390
an organization and the people it serves.

9
00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.175
Next, we explored ways to communicate
effectively to influence stakeholders'

10
00:00:33.175 --> 00:00:36.070
decisions related to security.

11
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.942
This included discussions about how to use
visuals to convey important information

12
00:00:40.942 --> 00:00:45.790
and sending emails, making phone calls, or
sending instant messages.

13
00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.498
After that, we shared some ways to engage
with the security community, including

14
00:00:50.498 --> 00:00:55.510
attending conferences and connecting with
other analysts through a networking site.

15
00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:59.091
Then we moved on to the final
section of the course,

16
00:00:59.091 --> 00:01:03.290
which covered how to find,
prepare for, and apply for jobs.

17
00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:07.361
This included discussions about how
to create a compelling resume and

18
00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:10.820
tips to help you navigate
the interview process.

19
00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.881
It's been an absolute pleasure
guiding you through this journey.
