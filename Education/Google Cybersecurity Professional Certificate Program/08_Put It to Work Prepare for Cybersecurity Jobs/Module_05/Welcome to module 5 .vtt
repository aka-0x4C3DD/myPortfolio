00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.120
Welcome back! We've covered

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.165
so many security related
topics in detail.

3
00:00:06.165 --> 00:00:07.690
Throughout this program,

4
00:00:07.690 --> 00:00:10.500
we've discussed protecting
organizational assets and data,

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.325
and the tools and
procedures used to protect them.

6
00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:17.670
We've also explored how to
communicate with stakeholders,

7
00:00:17.670 --> 00:00:20.640
reliable sources to
help you stay up-to-date

8
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.610
on security news
and trends, and ways

9
00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:26.430
to get involved with the
security community to help

10
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.620
establish and advance
your career in the field.

11
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.450
Now, we need to get
you prepared to find

12
00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:35.785
a job as an entry-level
security analyst.

13
00:00:35.785 --> 00:00:38.225
Security is a huge field

14
00:00:38.225 --> 00:00:40.520
with countless job
opportunities.

15
00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:44.270
By 2030, the U.S. Bureau
of Labor Statistics

16
00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.550
expects the number
of security roles to

17
00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:49.145
grow by more than 30%.

18
00:00:50.145 --> 00:00:52.595
But how can you find the
right opportunity for you?

19
00:00:52.595 --> 00:00:54.125
In the next several videos,

20
00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:56.720
we'll discuss specific
strategies to help

21
00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.494
you find and apply for
jobs in the industry,

22
00:00:59.494 --> 00:01:01.310
including how to create

23
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.765
your resume and develop
rapport with interviewers.

24
00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:07.790
We'll also cover how to
use the STAR method for

25
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.540
interviewing and how to
develop an elevator pitch.

26
00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:14.060
I remember initially
being interested in

27
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.685
my role because
education is my passion.

28
00:01:16.685 --> 00:01:18.530
Researching the security field

29
00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:20.090
and industry in preparation for

30
00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.990
my interviews cemented my
fascination for cybersecurity.

31
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.060
I'll be honest, I had taken

32
00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.235
a lot of what security
does for granted.

33
00:01:28.235 --> 00:01:31.550
Now, I feel incredibly
fortunate to be a part of

34
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:35.140
this industry and the exciting
opportunities it offers.

35
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.820
Now, it's time to
get you ready to

36
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.430
find security jobs.
Let's get started!
