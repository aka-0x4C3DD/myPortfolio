00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.270
In this video, we'll
explore a topic that can

2
00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.464
contribute to your success
during the interview process:

3
00:00:06.464 --> 00:00:09.790
How to build rapport with
your potential employer.

4
00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.910
Rapport is a friendly
relationship

5
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:13.215
in which the people involved

6
00:00:13.215 --> 00:00:14.880
understand each other's ideas

7
00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:17.115
and communicate well
with each other.

8
00:00:17.115 --> 00:00:19.260
Building rapport begins with

9
00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.240
the very first
interaction you have with

10
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:23.505
the company's staff by phone,

11
00:00:23.505 --> 00:00:25.905
email, or video conference.

12
00:00:25.905 --> 00:00:27.390
It's important to use

13
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:29.715
a professional tone in
the email you write,

14
00:00:29.715 --> 00:00:31.935
expressing your
interest in the job.

15
00:00:31.935 --> 00:00:35.520
But it's also important to
be polite and friendly.

16
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.210
Expressing appreciation for
being considered and having

17
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:40.590
the potential opportunity to

18
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.920
interview is one way
to build rapport.

19
00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.715
When and if you have an
initial phone screen,

20
00:00:46.715 --> 00:00:49.975
you can use a friendly,
conversational tone of voice.

21
00:00:49.975 --> 00:00:53.145
To do this, try smiling
while you talk.

22
00:00:53.145 --> 00:00:55.130
While it's true
that nobody can see

23
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.780
you smile on a phone call,

24
00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.125
smiling while you talk can
make you sound friendlier.

25
00:01:01.125 --> 00:01:03.304
During the phone screening
and in-person interview,

26
00:01:03.304 --> 00:01:05.660
you can ease interview
nervousness by

27
00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.960
engaging actively in a way
that feels natural to you.

28
00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.820
That can mean simply saying:

29
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.920
"Hello, nice to meet you."

30
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.220
You can even start a short,
friendly conversation

31
00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.175
by asking the interviewer
how their day is going.

32
00:01:19.175 --> 00:01:21.950
Or, if the weekend just passed,

33
00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:23.600
you might ask the interviewer:

34
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:25.090
"How was your weekend?"

35
00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.170
Make eye contact when you ask

36
00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.750
these questions during
an in-person interview,

37
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.730
or be sure to look directly into

38
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.115
the camera during
a video interview.

39
00:01:34.115 --> 00:01:36.050
This will show the
interviewer that

40
00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.270
you're engaged in
the conversation.

41
00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.525
Oftentimes, during the second
half of an interview,

42
00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:43.505
the interviewer will ask if

43
00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:45.965
you have any questions for them.

44
00:01:45.965 --> 00:01:47.765
As we discussed earlier,

45
00:01:47.765 --> 00:01:49.640
it's important to
have some questions

46
00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.910
prepared to ask at this point.

47
00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:53.955
Here are some suggestions.

48
00:01:53.955 --> 00:01:54.940
You could ask:

49
00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:58.310
What is the biggest challenge
I might face coming

50
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.350
into this role and how would

51
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.725
I be expected to
meet that challenge?"

52
00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:04.370
Or you might ask:

53
00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.530
"What would you say
is the best part

54
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:08.210
about working for this company?"

55
00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:12.395
Or: "What is a typical
day like for an analyst?"

56
00:02:13.395 --> 00:02:14.450
Another great question is:

57
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:17.540
"What is the potential
for growth in this role?"

58
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.600
Asking questions shows
that you're engaged in

59
00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.040
the conversation and you're

60
00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.514
interested in the company
and the position.

61
00:02:24.514 --> 00:02:27.800
It also shows the employer
that you are confident

62
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.620
and that you want to make
sure that their company is

63
00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.859
a good match for you before
you make a commitment.

64
00:02:34.859 --> 00:02:36.290
It's nice to send a
follow-up email a

65
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:38.720
day or two after your
in-person interview.

66
00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.690
This is just a brief email
thanking the interviewer for

67
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:43.445
the opportunity
to meet with them

68
00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:45.880
and learn more about
the organization.

69
00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.230
It's also a good idea to mention

70
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.310
something specific from your
interview in this email.

71
00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.060
It shows that you were actively

72
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.950
engaged in the conversation.

73
00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.930
Remember, the employer is

74
00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:59.090
probably interviewing
other candidates.

75
00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:01.850
So sending a follow-up
email will help set you

76
00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:05.600
apart and remind the
interviewer of your discussion.

77
00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.700
Building rapport
with the interviewer

78
00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:09.440
and other employees is

79
00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:10.820
an important skill when

80
00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.505
interviewing for your
first security position.

81
00:03:13.505 --> 00:03:16.160
Writing friendly but
professional emails

82
00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.370
before and after the
interview and engaging

83
00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.130
in friendly conversation
during the interview can

84
00:03:22.130 --> 00:03:26.070
help set you apart as a
great candidate for the job.
