00:00:00.828 --> 00:00:04.860
Now, let's discuss a concept that can
help you identify your strengths and

2
00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.574
allow you to highlight
those strengths to others:

3
00:00:07.574 --> 00:00:09.373
An elevator pitch.

4
00:00:10.373 --> 00:00:15.470
An elevator pitch is a brief summary of
your experience, skills, and background.

5
00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:19.304
It's called an elevator pitch
because it should be short enough to

6
00:00:19.304 --> 00:00:22.658
say in 60 seconds or less,
which is the average amount of time

7
00:00:22.658 --> 00:00:26.021
you might spend talking
with someone on an elevator.

8
00:00:27.021 --> 00:00:29.002
Elevator pitches allow
you to demonstrate who you are

9
00:00:29.002 --> 00:00:32.678
to potential employers
in a very short time span.

10
00:00:32.678 --> 00:00:38.243
They can be used at job fairs, career
expos, and other networking situations,

11
00:00:38.243 --> 00:00:43.745
like professional conferences and
social media job sites such as LinkedInÂ®.

12
00:00:44.745 --> 00:00:47.050
Now, let's examine how to
create an elevator pitch.

13
00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.098
Your elevator pitch needs to be short and
persuasive.

14
00:00:51.098 --> 00:00:56.536
There's no need to list all of your
previous experiences and accomplishments.

15
00:00:56.536 --> 00:01:02.873
Instead, explain who you are and why you
care about being a security professional,

16
00:01:02.873 --> 00:01:07.378
as well as the qualifications and
skills you have that are specifically

17
00:01:07.378 --> 00:01:10.394
related to getting a job
as a security analyst.

18
00:01:11.394 --> 00:01:14.092
For example, critical thinking,
problem-solving, and

19
00:01:14.092 --> 00:01:18.093
the ability to build collaborative
relationships with others

20
00:01:18.093 --> 00:01:22.406
are transferable skills that most
organizations are looking for.

21
00:01:22.406 --> 00:01:26.001
So, highlight those in
your elevator pitch.

22
00:01:27.001 --> 00:01:30.107
You could also mention technical
skills you've learned in this certificate program,

23
00:01:30.107 --> 00:01:34.459
such as using various SIEM tools and
programming languages

24
00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:39.813
like SQL and Python
to identify and respond to risks.

25
00:01:40.813 --> 00:01:45.250
Now, we'll cover a few things to avoid
when delivering your elevator pitch.

26
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:47.674
It's important to avoid rambling, or

27
00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:51.513
sharing irrelevant details,
during your elevator pitch.

28
00:01:51.513 --> 00:01:54.933
Potential employers only
want to know who you are and

29
00:01:54.933 --> 00:01:58.210
why they should consider you for
a security role.

30
00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:00.449
As you develop your elevator pitch,

31
00:02:00.449 --> 00:02:03.564
you're going to want to
practice it several times.

32
00:02:03.564 --> 00:02:08.349
However, don't practice it so
much that you end up sounding ingenuine or

33
00:02:08.349 --> 00:02:13.462
robotic when it's time to share your
pitch with a possible decision maker.

34
00:02:13.462 --> 00:02:17.889
Instead, speak naturally, like you're
having a conversation, when you give your

35
00:02:17.889 --> 00:02:18.875
elevator pitch.

36
00:02:18.875 --> 00:02:24.114
That will help keep people engaged and
interested in what you're saying.

37
00:02:25.114 --> 00:02:27.322
Another thing to avoid:
speaking too quickly.

38
00:02:27.322 --> 00:02:30.454
Because an elevator pitch is fairly short,

39
00:02:30.454 --> 00:02:35.364
it can be easy to rush through it.
But that can cause people to miss out

40
00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:40.376
on some key skills you have to offer,
simply because you sped past them.

41
00:02:41.376 --> 00:02:44.831
One last tip: search the internet for
elevator pitches to find

42
00:02:44.831 --> 00:02:49.213
examples that may help you
generate ideas for your own pitch.

43
00:02:50.213 --> 00:02:53.945
In essence, your elevator pitch
is a way to tell people why you

44
00:02:53.945 --> 00:02:59.314
are an amazing candidate for
a security position with great skills and

45
00:02:59.314 --> 00:03:03.600
a clear direction for
what you want to do in your career.

46
00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:08.481
While it's natural to be nervous when
speaking to potential employers, just remember:

47
00:03:08.481 --> 00:03:12.654
take a deep breath,
gather your composure, and

48
00:03:12.654 --> 00:03:17.555
deliver your pitch with confidence,
conviction, and at a normal pace.

49
00:03:17.555 --> 00:03:18.697
You'll be just fine.
