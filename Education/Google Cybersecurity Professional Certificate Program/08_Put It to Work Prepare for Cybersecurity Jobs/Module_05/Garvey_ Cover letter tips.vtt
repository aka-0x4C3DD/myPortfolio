[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.427 --> 00:00:09.009
My name is Garvey, I'm a global
staffing manager here at Google.

3
00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.387
I hire essentially all the cybersecurity
engineers here at Google.

4
00:00:12.387 --> 00:00:15.902
I've hired across the US, Zurich, London,

5
00:00:15.902 --> 00:00:20.687
Sydney, Australia, and
virtually any office that you name.

6
00:00:20.687 --> 00:00:25.314
This space is unique in the sense that
it's growing, it's vastly evolving.

7
00:00:25.314 --> 00:00:29.081
You have a number of candidates that have
pivoted, changed positions in their life,

8
00:00:29.081 --> 00:00:31.192
come from all different walks of life,
right?

9
00:00:31.192 --> 00:00:34.597
So, cover letters is an opportunity for
you to tell that story.

10
00:00:34.597 --> 00:00:37.595
A resume tells me the facts,
what have you done, but

11
00:00:37.595 --> 00:00:39.651
a cover letter tells me who you are.

12
00:00:39.651 --> 00:00:41.395
Why cybersecurity?

13
00:00:41.395 --> 00:00:44.999
Why this space, why this opportunity?

14
00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:46.633
What draws you here?

15
00:00:46.633 --> 00:00:50.255
Most folks that I've met that want to
enter this space have a reason.

16
00:00:50.255 --> 00:00:54.515
Either they've been the victim of some
sort of cybercrime, or they know others

17
00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:58.648
who have, or they've seen something
that has affected them in their lives,

18
00:00:58.648 --> 00:01:00.701
that has brought them to that moment.

19
00:01:00.701 --> 00:01:01.935
I want to know more about that.

20
00:01:01.935 --> 00:01:04.679
I want to understand what your passion is,
what your interest is in this space.

21
00:01:04.679 --> 00:01:07.378
So I think in particular when
it comes to cybersecurity,

22
00:01:07.378 --> 00:01:10.751
when it comes to cover letters,
it's your opportunity to tell me kind of

23
00:01:10.751 --> 00:01:14.603
what's written in between those lines
of that resume that's brought you here.

24
00:01:14.603 --> 00:01:16.424
How long should a cover letter be?

25
00:01:16.424 --> 00:01:18.560
I don't think there's any
perfect science to that, you know.

26
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.751
First give me a few lines about yourself,
your family, your hobbies.

27
00:01:22.751 --> 00:01:26.275
And then after that, really kind
of cut to what makes you unique,

28
00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:29.172
what makes you different
than this other applicant?

29
00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:31.014
What has brought you to this opportunity?

30
00:01:31.014 --> 00:01:32.503
How have you overcome adversity?

31
00:01:32.503 --> 00:01:34.957
How do you plan to do so
in this work environment?

32
00:01:34.957 --> 00:01:36.505
What does this job mean to you?

33
00:01:36.505 --> 00:01:38.958
What are the soft skills
that you can present and

34
00:01:38.958 --> 00:01:40.991
bring to your colleagues in this role?

35
00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:43.947
If I'm a candidate that's
making a career transition,

36
00:01:43.947 --> 00:01:46.050
I want to know in that cover letter, why?

37
00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:48.988
Is there a particular reason
cybersecurity excites you?

38
00:01:48.988 --> 00:01:52.000
Is there a particular reason
you're making this transition?

39
00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.784
What haven't you found
in your previous career?

40
00:01:54.784 --> 00:01:56.030
I want you here forever, right?

41
00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:58.632
And if I keep you here forever,
I want to keep you happy, right?

42
00:01:58.632 --> 00:02:00.215
So what makes you happy?

43
00:02:00.215 --> 00:02:03.601
What are the things that you see in
this space that are going to excite you,

44
00:02:03.601 --> 00:02:05.190
that you're passionate about?

45
00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:07.139
All right, I want to see that
written on the cover letter.

46
00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:09.815
Don't just sort of standardize
your cover letter and

47
00:02:09.815 --> 00:02:12.913
just fire it off regardless of
the company that it is, right?

48
00:02:12.913 --> 00:02:15.261
Tailor your cover letter
around that mission.

49
00:02:15.261 --> 00:02:16.517
What's their mission?

50
00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:17.736
Make it a part of your own.

51
00:02:17.736 --> 00:02:21.321
Know the company's mission,
know their purpose, their products.

52
00:02:21.321 --> 00:02:23.110
Insert that in your cover letter.

53
00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.197
A cover letter is meant to capture
someone's attention quickly.

54
00:02:26.197 --> 00:02:29.053
You can't manage to capture
the attention of someone for

55
00:02:29.053 --> 00:02:31.442
the entirety of what you've written,
right?

56
00:02:31.442 --> 00:02:35.267
So, what is it about you that interests
me, that brings you to this time and

57
00:02:35.267 --> 00:02:36.316
this opportunity?

58
00:02:36.316 --> 00:02:40.198
You want to capture someone's eye first
and then capture their attention and

59
00:02:40.198 --> 00:02:41.297
their mind, right?

60
00:02:41.297 --> 00:02:43.448
So be bold, be loud, right?

61
00:02:43.448 --> 00:02:46.670
I think keep the words simple,
but like, be bold.
