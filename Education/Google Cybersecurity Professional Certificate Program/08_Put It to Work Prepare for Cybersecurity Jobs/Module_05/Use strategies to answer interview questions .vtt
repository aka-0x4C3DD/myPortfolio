00:00:01.017 --> 00:00:02.600
Welcome back!

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:03.434
Preparing for

3
00:00:03.434 --> 00:00:07.337
job interviews in the security
field is such an exciting process.

4
00:00:07.337 --> 00:00:11.036
You've learned a lot through this
program that can help you stand out

5
00:00:11.036 --> 00:00:12.650
as a candidate.

6
00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:18.242
Let's discuss some useful interview
strategies to consider when speaking to an employer.

7
00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:22.273
Your interviewer is going to ask
several questions when you meet.

8
00:00:22.273 --> 00:00:26.342
Carefully consider each
question before responding.

9
00:00:26.342 --> 00:00:31.320
Let's discuss the STAR method, which
can help you prepare for interviews.

10
00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.624
The STAR Method is a technique
used to answer behavioral and

11
00:00:34.624 --> 00:00:37.240
situational interview questions.

12
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:41.950
Using this method is a great way to help
you understand each interview question and

13
00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:45.140
provide a thoughtful and
thorough response.

14
00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.752
STAR stands for: Situation, Task,

15
00:00:49.752 --> 00:00:53.217
Action, Result.

16
00:00:54.217 --> 00:00:58.004
The STAR method is typically used to
answer open-ended questions such as:

17
00:00:58.004 --> 00:01:02.340
"Tell me about a time when you
encountered a challenge on the job?"

18
00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.708
Let's go through an example of how this
question could be answered using the STAR method.

19
00:01:08.708 --> 00:01:12.689
The situation: Two people needed to
stay home for work due to illness, and

20
00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:17.130
I was the only person
available to assist customers.

21
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:21.988
The task: I needed to answer phone
calls from customers, while assisting

22
00:01:21.988 --> 00:01:24.030
shoppers in the store.

23
00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:29.335
The action: I came up with a strategy that
allowed me to assist customers as they

24
00:01:29.335 --> 00:01:34.562
entered the store while also ensuring
that customers who called were helped or

25
00:01:34.562 --> 00:01:38.861
politely placed on hold until I
was able to address their needs.

26
00:01:39.861 --> 00:01:43.018
The result: I managed the in-store
operations for the day without many

27
00:01:43.018 --> 00:01:47.510
mistakes, and my manager complimented
me during the next team meeting.

28
00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.291
Hopefully this example highlights the
benefits of answering open-ended interview

29
00:01:52.291 --> 00:01:54.840
questions using the STAR method.

30
00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.510
But the STAR method isn't the only
strategy you can use during an interview.

31
00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:02.760
You can also answer
questions with confidence.

32
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.410
One way to demonstrate confidence is by
admitting when you don't know something.

33
00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.339
For example, if an interviewer asks you
to discuss a skill that you don't have,

34
00:02:13.339 --> 00:02:16.390
it's okay to admit you
haven't learned it yet.

35
00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:21.222
However, the trick is to confidently
mention that while you don't have that

36
00:02:21.222 --> 00:02:26.070
particular skill, you're a quick learner
and eager to develop that skill.

37
00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.187
Treat it as an opportunity to
emphasize your ability to adapt and

38
00:02:30.187 --> 00:02:33.740
learn on the job, which shows confidence!

39
00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.124
You know what else shows confidence?

40
00:02:36.124 --> 00:02:39.056
Taking the time to fully
understand a problem or

41
00:02:39.056 --> 00:02:43.450
question to provide the best solution or
answer possible.

42
00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:46.800
When interviewing,
don't be afraid to ask the interviewer for

43
00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.290
a moment to think about your answer.

44
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.964
It shows that you're willing to take the
time needed to understand the question and

45
00:02:53.964 --> 00:02:56.981
provide a response that is meaningful and
relevant.

46
00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.079
We've discussed a few strategies that can
help you overcome the nervousness you may feel

47
00:03:03.079 --> 00:03:05.459
about interviewing for a job.

48
00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.919
Coming up, we'll continue to explore
ways to prepare for interviews.
