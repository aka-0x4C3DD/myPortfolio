Hi, I'm Emily and I'm a
program manager at Google.

2
00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:10.660
I work in our security
education space.

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.945
Imposter syndrome is
a very real thing.

4
00:00:13.945 --> 00:00:15.070
There will be days where you

5
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.405
feel like you're riding high,

6
00:00:16.405 --> 00:00:17.590
you're getting everything done,

7
00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:19.060
you're on top of your game.

8
00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.710
Then there are times
where you feel

9
00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.510
like I just don't
know what I'm doing.

10
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:24.745
Everybody else is
doing so much better.

11
00:00:24.745 --> 00:00:26.380
Connecting with others in

12
00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:29.140
cybersecurity associations
is a great way

13
00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.135
to combat that
imposter syndrome.

14
00:00:31.135 --> 00:00:32.290
Getting involved in

15
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:35.080
cybersecurity organizations
and associations is

16
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.450
a great way to grow
your network and

17
00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:39.880
frankly build a
community for yourself.

18
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:43.155
It can be really intimidating
to join a new industry.

19
00:00:43.155 --> 00:00:44.855
Those folks can support you,

20
00:00:44.855 --> 00:00:48.380
and they can also be a
great example of how far

21
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:52.190
you've come when you share
your skills with them as well.

22
00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:56.180
What helped me when I was
feeling imposter syndrome

23
00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:57.890
or just not feeling as

24
00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.080
confident as I think
I could have been,

25
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.025
was connecting with
a trusted mentor.

26
00:01:03.025 --> 00:01:05.390
They were really
helpful when I said,

27
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.375
"Oh gosh, I feel like
I should know this."

28
00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:11.590
And she said, "There's no way
you can know everything.

29
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:14.600
We have people who
work on those things

30
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.080
across the company and you
don't have to know everything."

31
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.730
It just helped calm me down

32
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:21.290
and helped me feel
comfortable with what I

33
00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.940
do know and the skills that I do

34
00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:25.190
bring to my organization.

35
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:28.820
It's really important to
recognize those small wins.

36
00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.970
I actually like to go to a
special folder I have in

37
00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.420
my email where I've
collected kudos

38
00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:37.700
and special emails
that folks have

39
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.355
sent me who are
congratulating me on

40
00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:43.400
a project accomplishment
or just complimenting me

41
00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.790
on some skill or something
that I helped them out with.

42
00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:49.655
And that really helps buoy my
spirits and reminds me that,

43
00:01:49.655 --> 00:01:50.990
yes, I can do this.

44
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:52.520
There is a reason I'm here.

45
00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:55.985
Reflecting on your career no
matter where you've worked,

46
00:01:55.985 --> 00:01:57.380
is a really great way to

47
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.405
combat imposter
syndrome as well.

48
00:01:59.405 --> 00:02:02.285
It's a great way to show
how far you've come,

49
00:02:02.285 --> 00:02:04.640
what skills you've
learned and what you're

50
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.660
really going to be able to
contribute in this new field.

51
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:09.345
In the security industry,

52
00:02:09.345 --> 00:02:10.980
you're never going
to know everything,

53
00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:16.250
and so it's important to stay
flexible and fungible and

54
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.395
to ensure that you're
always learning

55
00:02:18.395 --> 00:02:19.970
because the industry changes

56
00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:21.620
so quickly and
evolves so quickly.

57
00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:24.035
There's not one person who's
going to know everything.

58
00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:27.380
It can be really hard to
maintain your confidence,

59
00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:29.770
especially when
you're new on a job.

60
00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:33.845
It's okay to take time
and to ask questions.

61
00:02:33.845 --> 00:02:35.660
There's never a stupid question.

62
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:36.980
It's important for you to get

63
00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:39.020
information and the
folks around you should

64
00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:42.215
be trying to support you
and help you succeed,

65
00:02:42.215 --> 00:02:46.110
because they too will
succeed with your success.
