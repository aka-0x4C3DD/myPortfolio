In this video, we'll take a little time
to discuss additional strategies you can use

2
00:00:06.057 --> 00:00:07.741
during a job interview.

3
00:00:08.741 --> 00:00:11.582
In past job interviews,
your potential employer may have asked:

4
00:00:11.582 --> 00:00:14.240
"Do you have any questions for me?"

5
00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.747
This type of question can
be an opportunity for

6
00:00:16.747 --> 00:00:19.641
you to show the interviewer
that you're prepared and

7
00:00:19.641 --> 00:00:22.481
ready to have a meaningful
conversation with them.

8
00:00:23.481 --> 00:00:26.364
A big part of interview preparation
is researching the company before

9
00:00:26.364 --> 00:00:30.575
the interview because it will allow
you to ask questions that demonstrate

10
00:00:30.575 --> 00:00:34.300
you took the time to learn about
the organization and its needs.

11
00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.000
These kinds of questions show that
you're passionate about your career and

12
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:42.000
that you want to help the company
strengthen its security posture.

13
00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.000
There are also some general questions
you can ask the interviewer to

14
00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.000
determine if the job and the organization
itself are a good match for you.

15
00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.000
Here are some examples:

16
00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
"What's the biggest challenge for a new person
in this role?"

17
00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.521
"In what ways can I contribute to the
success of the team and the organization?"

18
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.058
"What qualities or traits are most important
for working well with the team and other stakeholders?"

19
00:01:13.058 --> 00:01:17.543
Questions like these can help you develop
rapport with the interviewer, and show that

20
00:01:17.543 --> 00:01:22.000
you're interested in learning more about
the role and the organizational culture.

21
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.400
Interviewing for jobs can be a really
exciting process when you're prepared, and

22
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:30.710
asking questions is an essential
part of the interview process.

23
00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.590
Don't be afraid to ask potential
employers tough questions.

24
00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.100
This will help them understand
you as a thoughtful, curious

25
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.700
person who can
add value to the team.

26
00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:45.700
