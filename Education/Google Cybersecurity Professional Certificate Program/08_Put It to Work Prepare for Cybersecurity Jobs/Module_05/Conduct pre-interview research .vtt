00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.660
Previously, we
discussed how to create

2
00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:06.750
a resume and what to expect
during an interview.

3
00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:09.150
In this video, we're
going to cover

4
00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.520
a few more things that
you need to do to

5
00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:14.220
prepare for the interview
and that could help set

6
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.445
you apart as an excellent
candidate for the position.

7
00:00:18.445 --> 00:00:19.230
Before the interview,

8
00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.110
it's important to do
some research about

9
00:00:21.110 --> 00:00:23.375
the organization you're
interviewing with.

10
00:00:23.375 --> 00:00:26.300
Interviewers want to know
that you're a good match for

11
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.010
their team and that you value

12
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:30.455
the things that are
important to the company.

13
00:00:30.455 --> 00:00:33.260
It's just as important
for you to decide

14
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:36.020
if the company
matches your values.

15
00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:39.935
So make sure you know the organization's
mission and vision.

16
00:00:39.935 --> 00:00:43.925
Understand their core
values and company culture.

17
00:00:43.925 --> 00:00:47.930
This information is usually
easy to find either in

18
00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.850
the job description or on

19
00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.230
the "About" page of the
organization's website.

20
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:55.760
Think about why these values and

21
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.865
the company culture are
also important to you.

22
00:00:58.865 --> 00:01:00.950
Then, practice how you will

23
00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:03.620
communicate this to
potential employers.

24
00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:05.330
Remember that you will not be

25
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:07.340
the only applicant
for the position.

26
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:10.790
Consider what sets you apart
from other candidates and

27
00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.110
be prepared to emphasize

28
00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:14.345
those qualities
during the interview.

29
00:01:15.345 --> 00:01:16.205
What about your skills,

30
00:01:16.205 --> 00:01:18.275
experience, or work ethic

31
00:01:18.275 --> 00:01:21.055
make you the best match
for this position?

32
00:01:21.055 --> 00:01:25.370
How do your goals align to the
goals of the organization?

33
00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:27.800
You want the employer
to remember you

34
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.260
after they've interviewed
several candidates.

35
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:31.895
So highlight things that make

36
00:01:31.895 --> 00:01:34.330
you the best candidate
for the role.

37
00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.460
You also want to think about
the employer's perspective.

38
00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.350
The organization has needs that

39
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:41.570
must be met by
filling the position.

40
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.030
They may have productivity
or compliance

41
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.070
goals. Or the team might be

42
00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.620
growing because the
company is expanding.

43
00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:50.510
Take some time to
think about what

44
00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.045
the interviewer is
seeking in a candidate.

45
00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:54.920
Then prepare yourself to state

46
00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.800
directly how you can meet
the employer's needs.

47
00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.240
The interviewer may have

48
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.160
reservations about
hiring you because

49
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.580
of your lack of experience
as a security analyst.

50
00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.605
If this comes up
in the interview,

51
00:02:06.605 --> 00:02:07.790
be prepared to address

52
00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:09.560
any possible concerns by

53
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.885
speaking about your
strong work ethic.

54
00:02:11.885 --> 00:02:15.380
This could include an ability
to learn quickly based on

55
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.430
feedback, or to collaborate
and communicate with others.

56
00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:23.090
Also, you could discuss
having a security mindset,

57
00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:24.980
or problem solving
skills that you've

58
00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:26.840
developed from personal life,

59
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:30.215
work, or educational experiences.

60
00:02:31.215 --> 00:02:33.980
Learning about the organization's
culture and mission and

61
00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.900
preparing to
demonstrate how you can

62
00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:38.525
add value to the
team are essential.

63
00:02:38.525 --> 00:02:40.430
It's also a good idea to write

64
00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.080
down questions that you can ask

65
00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.400
the interviewer about

66
00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.270
the organization's past
accomplishments and future goals.

67
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:49.790
This shows potential
employers that you've done

68
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.680
your research and care about
the organization's success.

69
00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:55.820
Coming up, we'll discuss how to

70
00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.800
build rapport with interviewers.
