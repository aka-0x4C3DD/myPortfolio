Hi, I'm Karan.

2
00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:08.160
I'm a security engineering
manager here at Google.

3
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:11.180
As part of my job, I do
participate in hiring candidates.

4
00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:12.870
And so far I've spoken to like

5
00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.750
hundreds of candidates,
potential candidates,

6
00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.520
people who actually got into

7
00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.710
Google. Almost every
time I meet somebody,

8
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.275
I get to see a new path.

9
00:00:22.275 --> 00:00:23.880
And that's always fascinating for

10
00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.235
me to learn about somebody else.

11
00:00:25.235 --> 00:00:27.900
One thing I'm seeing
very interestingly is

12
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.475
the increase in the
number of people

13
00:00:29.475 --> 00:00:31.110
who come from
non-technical backgrounds.

14
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:32.625
So that can be recruiting,

15
00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:34.080
sales, like you name it,

16
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:36.015
we're seeing a ton of people.

17
00:00:36.015 --> 00:00:37.560
So, for preparing for interviews,

18
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.740
I think you can break
down that question

19
00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:41.150
into technical

20
00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:43.085
preparation and
non-technical preparation.

21
00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:44.435
And so for technical preparation,

22
00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:47.975
I advise people to build up on, you know
networking fundamentals,

23
00:00:47.975 --> 00:00:49.550
information security
fundamentals,

24
00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.200
get all those concepts right,

25
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.685
so you understand
how things work,

26
00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.350
how are they related,
and all of that.

27
00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.480
Make sure you ask clarifying
questions to get to

28
00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.740
the root of the problem and what

29
00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.050
the interviewer wants from you.

30
00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.560
A lot of people just dive into

31
00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:02.495
the problem without
really clarifying.

32
00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.935
If you don't know something,

33
00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:05.000
don't be afraid to say,

34
00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.485
"I don't know" and say,

35
00:01:06.485 --> 00:01:08.945
but here's how I would
approach the problem.

36
00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:10.535
For the non-technical pieces,

37
00:01:10.535 --> 00:01:12.590
I think practice with a friend,

38
00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:13.955
have an interview partner,

39
00:01:13.955 --> 00:01:15.110
and see how you respond.

40
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:16.325
See where you fumble,

41
00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:19.265
and be kind to yourself
as you're doing that.

42
00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:21.815
Focus on bringing your whole
self to the interview.

43
00:01:21.815 --> 00:01:24.720
So that means showcasing how
you'll work with a team.

44
00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.755
Bring up examples of projects
you have done with others,

45
00:01:27.755 --> 00:01:29.450
how you have led those projects?

46
00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:31.565
Have you done open-source
collaborations?

47
00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:33.260
A lot of these soft skills,

48
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.180
if I may put them as are super

49
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.630
crucial even when you're
solving a security problem.

50
00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:41.000
So those are some key aspects
that we're looking

51
00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.510
for when we are
interviewing for roles.

52
00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:45.320
For new folks in the industry,

53
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:48.515
the main thing we would be
looking for is curiosity.

54
00:01:48.515 --> 00:01:51.260
Personally speaking, I look
for people who have drive,

55
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.915
who are very driven to
learn more about the field,

56
00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:56.060
they may not know everything
and we know that,

57
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.640
but we want to make sure
that they are asking

58
00:01:58.640 --> 00:01:59.960
the right questions
and getting through

59
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.590
the problem by
working with others.

60
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.140
So, if you get an answer
like, I don't know,

61
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.740
but I'll figure it out, and
here's how, that's amazing.

62
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.080
Also, I'll say don't be
afraid of rejection,

63
00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.445
because it takes time to
find your first role.

64
00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:13.355
It took me hundreds of
applications to find my first job.

65
00:02:13.355 --> 00:02:15.590
And then don't be afraid to
apply even if you don't meet

66
00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.930
all the required or
preferred qualifications,

67
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.075
just look at the
minimum qualifications.

68
00:02:20.075 --> 00:02:22.730
And if you do pass that, you know, it
doesn't hurt to apply.

69
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.080
So, please keep applying.
