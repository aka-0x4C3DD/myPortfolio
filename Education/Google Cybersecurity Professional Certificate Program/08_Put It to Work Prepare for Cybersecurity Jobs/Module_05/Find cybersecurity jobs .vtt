00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:04.155
I hope you feel really proud
of how far you've come!

2
00:00:04.155 --> 00:00:06.825
You may remember that
earlier in this program,

3
00:00:06.825 --> 00:00:09.840
we discussed a few security
roles in the industry.

4
00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:12.735
Now, we'll explore
three of those roles.

5
00:00:12.735 --> 00:00:15.404
We'll start with
security analyst.

6
00:00:16.404 --> 00:00:18.840
Security analyst is typically
an entry-level role that

7
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:20.460
might interest you
as you prepare

8
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:22.525
to enter the security field.

9
00:00:22.525 --> 00:00:25.055
The role generally focuses on

10
00:00:25.055 --> 00:00:28.415
monitoring networks
for security breaches,

11
00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:32.015
developing strategies to
help secure an organization,

12
00:00:32.015 --> 00:00:35.570
and even researching
IT security trends.

13
00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:38.240
In previous courses,
we discussed

14
00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.925
log monitoring and SIEM tools.

15
00:00:40.925 --> 00:00:44.540
Having a solid foundational
understanding of how to

16
00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:48.005
use those tools will certainly
be useful in this role.

17
00:00:49.005 --> 00:00:50.120
Another role that
might interest you

18
00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.730
is information security analyst.

19
00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:55.100
This role generally focuses on

20
00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.395
creating plans and implementing

21
00:00:57.395 --> 00:00:59.570
security measures to protect

22
00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.785
organizations'
networks and systems.

23
00:01:02.785 --> 00:01:04.535
Earlier in the program,

24
00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:07.760
you learned about controls
and frameworks that can

25
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.255
be used to develop security
plans and procedures,

26
00:01:11.255 --> 00:01:13.520
as well as how to use SIEMs and

27
00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.720
packet sniffers to
identify risks.

28
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.190
That knowledge will
be beneficial when

29
00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:21.470
it comes to developing plans and

30
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.630
determining the best
tools to strengthen

31
00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.665
an organization's
security posture.

32
00:01:27.665 --> 00:01:28.950
Finally, we'll explore

33
00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:32.270
the security operations
center analyst role.

34
00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:34.715
Security operations
center analyst,

35
00:01:34.715 --> 00:01:36.605
also known as a SOC analyst,

36
00:01:36.605 --> 00:01:39.215
is another role you
might find exciting.

37
00:01:39.215 --> 00:01:41.705
This role generally focuses on

38
00:01:41.705 --> 00:01:44.405
ensuring security
incidents are handled

39
00:01:44.405 --> 00:01:46.610
rapidly and efficiently by

40
00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.165
following established
policies and procedures.

41
00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:51.995
Earlier in this program,

42
00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:54.440
we discussed security
playbooks and

43
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.605
how they are unique
to each organization.

44
00:01:57.605 --> 00:01:59.960
We also covered
the importance of

45
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:02.090
being able to follow
the processes

46
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.950
outlined in playbooks to

47
00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:06.875
respond to security
events or incidents.

48
00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:09.290
That knowledge will
certainly help you stand

49
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:12.050
out as a potential
candidate for this role.

50
00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:13.790
There are many more job roles

51
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:15.530
that you may be interested in.

52
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.530
A great way to find
more of these roles is

53
00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:21.425
to create an account
on various job sites

54
00:02:21.425 --> 00:02:24.515
and search for cybersecurity
positions.

55
00:02:24.515 --> 00:02:27.470
A few well-known job sites in

56
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:31.715
the United States and
internationally are ZipRecruiter,

57
00:02:31.715 --> 00:02:35.035
Indeed, and Monster Jobs.

58
00:02:35.035 --> 00:02:38.000
Each of these sites
have hundreds of

59
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.625
open job listings with roles,

60
00:02:40.625 --> 00:02:42.005
responsibilities,

61
00:02:42.005 --> 00:02:45.440
and skill set requirements
posted under the job title.

62
00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.229
How exciting is it that
we're now discussing

63
00:02:48.229 --> 00:02:51.665
jobs and sites that you
can use to apply for them!?

64
00:02:51.665 --> 00:02:53.600
It's important that
you do your research

65
00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.915
before applying to any position.

66
00:02:55.915 --> 00:02:59.135
Gather plenty of information
about the company,

67
00:02:59.135 --> 00:03:03.605
the job role, as well as
required and preferred skills.

68
00:03:03.605 --> 00:03:07.160
This will help prepare you
for a potential interview by

69
00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:10.370
knowing exactly what the
employer is looking for

70
00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:11.675
and how your skills

71
00:03:11.675 --> 00:03:14.320
align with the
employer's expectations.

72
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:17.720
This will also help you
align your own values

73
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.620
and passions with the
organization's mission and vision.

74
00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:24.320
But before you can apply
for a security job,

75
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:25.610
it's important to create

76
00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.390
a resume that will catch
an employer's attention.

77
00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:30.020
Coming up, we'll discuss

78
00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:33.330
the resume development
process in detail.
