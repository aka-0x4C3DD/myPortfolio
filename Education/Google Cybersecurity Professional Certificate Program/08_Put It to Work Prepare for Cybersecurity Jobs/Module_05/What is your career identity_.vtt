00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.310
- Hi there.

2
00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:04.830
I'm Miriam and I work at Google.

3
00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:06.360
We're so glad you're here

4
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.970
and that you've chosen a
Google Career Certificate

5
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.770
to move towards your goals.

6
00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:13.560
One important step to
help you meet those goals

7
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.960
is building your career identity.

8
00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.710
But first, what exactly
is career identity?

9
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.770
You can think of it as your North Star.

10
00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:24.570
It encompasses who you are

11
00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.670
and what you have to offer professionally

12
00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:28.260
and guides you as you navigate

13
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.420
towards your goals and vision.

14
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.779
Today, we'll share activities

15
00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:34.470
to help you explore your career identity

16
00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:37.110
and write your own career
identity statement.

17
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:38.193
Let's dive in.

18
00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.730
Your career identity is the unique value

19
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.530
that you bring to the workforce

20
00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.590
based on who you are and
what you have to offer

21
00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.690
now and in the future.

22
00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.110
It's informed by all of your
life and work experiences

23
00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:59.310
and shaped by your strengths,
motivations, and values.

24
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:01.710
It's also something you cultivate

25
00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:04.200
based on your direction and goals,

26
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:06.780
and here's why it's important.

27
00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.130
The more you know about who
you are, what makes you thrive,

28
00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:12.330
and where you want to go,

29
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.360
the better equipped you are
to choose a path that aligns

30
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:18.360
with your strengths, values, and goals.

31
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:20.520
Plus, employers and colleagues

32
00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.080
will have a better understanding

33
00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.010
of what you have to offer
and it's good for you.

34
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:29.160
Research shows that having
a strong career identity

35
00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:33.060
leads to positive outcomes such
as improved job performance,

36
00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.640
greater commitment to a meaningful career,

37
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.550
and even enhanced well-being and health.

38
00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:42.960
Remember, no matter what your
life and work experiences are,

39
00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:45.330
we all have value to offer.

40
00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:47.688
Let me start by sharing
a little bit about myself

41
00:01:47.688 --> 00:01:51.540
and how I first started to
develop my career identity.

42
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:54.240
I've worked at Google
for more than 10 years,

43
00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.600
but I discovered facets
of my career identity

44
00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.380
in my first role here

45
00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.990
as an email customer
support representative

46
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:03.570
helping business owners solve problems.

47
00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:05.130
I quickly realized how much

48
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.680
I enjoyed working with sales, engineering,

49
00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:10.770
and product management teams
to solve those problems.

50
00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:12.930
I also discovered that I had a talent

51
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:14.730
for distilling complex ideas

52
00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.390
into simple written language
for the customers I supported.

53
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:22.290
Fast forward to today, I
work in digital marketing,

54
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.250
and my job still depends on
communication and collaboration,

55
00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.260
skills that bring me joy.

56
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:31.620
Over the years, I've moved
from one project to another,

57
00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.560
changed jobs, and worked
for different companies,

58
00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:36.960
but these truths about what is core to me

59
00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.500
and what I value have
always remained the same.

60
00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.880
Make sense?

61
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.760
One of the best ways to
explore your career identity

62
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.610
is to write your own
career identity statement.

63
00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:50.940
We'll start by breaking it
down into three key components

64
00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:52.710
that will act as the building blocks

65
00:02:52.710 --> 00:02:55.590
for creating your own
career identity statement,

66
00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.120
your strengths,

67
00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.830
your motivations,

68
00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:00.330
your values.

69
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:02.850
Let's talk about each of
these three components

70
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.410
in more detail.

71
00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:06.093
First up, your strengths.

72
00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.800
Your strengths are tasks and
activities that you do well.

73
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.600
They're the skills, knowledge,

74
00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.100
and talents you've gained

75
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.830
throughout your life and work experiences.

76
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.310
For example, maybe you're
very detail-oriented

77
00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.130
or you're great at building relationships.

78
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:29.160
Maybe you're amazing at repairing cars

79
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:33.300
or maybe you've developed
skills like patience, empathy,

80
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.830
and problem-solving

81
00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.560
as a result of caring for a family member.

82
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.330
According to Marcus Buckingham,

83
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.127
an expert on strengths
and leadership at work,

84
00:03:42.127 --> 00:03:46.140
"A strength is an activity
that strengthens you."

85
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:49.800
For something to be a strength,
you must be good at it,

86
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.170
but it also should make you feel stronger,

87
00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.660
more capable, and energized.

88
00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:58.020
For me, writing has
always been a strength.

89
00:03:58.020 --> 00:04:01.170
I read Charlotte Bronte's
novel, "Jane Eyre" at age nine

90
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:04.380
and I fell in love with writing.

91
00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:07.020
I was like, "That girl is me

92
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:09.450
and I want to write books like this."

93
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:11.460
I then invested a lot of time

94
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.400
in developing this
skill throughout my life

95
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.100
and it's one that has always energized me,

96
00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.280
making it a core pillar
of my career identity.

97
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:23.670
From strengths, we'll move
to the next key component,

98
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:25.023
your motivations.

99
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:32.970
Your motivations stem from
your passions and your purpose.

100
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.430
Knowing what fuels you is so important,

101
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.010
because that's what keeps you going.

102
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:41.070
Like I mentioned, I am
passionate about storytelling

103
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:42.810
with the English language.

104
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:45.570
I can lose myself for hours in writing,

105
00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:47.880
but I don't just enjoy telling stories.

106
00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:49.922
I am also motivated to help others

107
00:04:49.922 --> 00:04:53.610
to express their own truths
through authentic storytelling.

108
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:55.740
It's a defining aspect of who I am

109
00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:58.290
and thus my career identity.

110
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.710
So now we've covered
strengths and motivations.

111
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:06.123
Lastly, let's discuss the third
key component, your values.

112
00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:13.620
Your values reflect what's
most important to you.

113
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:15.750
They guide your approach
to decision-making,

114
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:19.620
developing relationships,
and overcoming challenges.

115
00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.170
You may not always be
aware of your values,

116
00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:26.370
but they are always with you
even if they shift over time.

117
00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:28.380
These are things like integrity,

118
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:30.840
responsibility, and kindness.

119
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:35.580
Some of my core values are
efficiency and service to others.

120
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.900
I don't like messes.

121
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.990
When I see a mess, I see people suffering.

122
00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:43.110
My mind goes to, "How
can I help clean this up?

123
00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:45.300
How can I make this more efficient?"

124
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.245
In my first job, I realized
that no one was documenting

125
00:05:48.245 --> 00:05:50.910
how to use the products
Google was developing.

126
00:05:50.910 --> 00:05:53.070
So I decided to build a knowledge base

127
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.930
of common questions and answers

128
00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.100
that my team could use

129
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.100
to not have to start
from scratch each time.

130
00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:01.650
Now that we understand the key components,

131
00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:04.203
let's work on building
your own career identity.

132
00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.700
To start, all you need
to do is get curious.

133
00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:14.730
Begin by asking yourself
these three questions

134
00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:18.667
about your strengths,
motivations, and values.

135
00:06:18.667 --> 00:06:22.623
"What skills, knowledge,
and talents set me apart?

136
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:26.310
What fuels and motivates me most?

137
00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:29.100
What values guide me?"

138
00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.560
It might be helpful to
pause the video here,

139
00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.360
grab a piece of paper or a journal

140
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.120
and spend 10 minutes
reflecting on these questions.

141
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.830
There's no need to overthink it.

142
00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:39.960
Just write what comes to mind.

143
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:42.633
You can always refine or
expand your answers later.

144
00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:49.740
Once you've answered these questions,

145
00:06:49.740 --> 00:06:53.550
there's more you can do to
dig into your career identity.

146
00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.250
For example, assessments
can help you learn more

147
00:06:56.250 --> 00:06:57.660
about your unique skills,

148
00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:00.330
strengths, preferences, and values.

149
00:07:00.330 --> 00:07:03.030
Many of these assessments
are available online

150
00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:06.000
and consist of a series of
short multiple choice questions

151
00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.320
focused on you

152
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.800
and immediately produce
your personalized results.

153
00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:13.500
If after this, you still
want to explore more,

154
00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.110
you can interview a handful of your peers.

155
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:18.150
They could be current
or former colleagues,

156
00:07:18.150 --> 00:07:20.820
classmates, or even family and friends.

157
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.070
Choose people who know you well

158
00:07:23.070 --> 00:07:26.550
and who you trust to be
honest and thoughtful.

159
00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:28.207
Ask them questions such as,

160
00:07:28.207 --> 00:07:31.200
"How would you describe
me to someone else?

161
00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:33.240
What stands out about me?

162
00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:35.370
How do I inspire you?"

163
00:07:35.370 --> 00:07:37.620
Remember, there are plenty of other ways

164
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.210
to learn about yourself,

165
00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:41.310
but once you've reached a
point where you're comfortable

166
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:43.462
and confident that you
understand your strengths,

167
00:07:43.462 --> 00:07:45.540
motivations, and values,

168
00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:48.813
you can bring them together in
a career identity statement.

169
00:07:52.620 --> 00:07:54.210
It should be three or four sentences

170
00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:57.450
that go beyond just listing
your qualifications.

171
00:07:57.450 --> 00:08:00.840
You want to also reveal
your passions and purpose.

172
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:03.907
Here's a basic template
to help you get started.

173
00:08:03.907 --> 00:08:08.527
"I am a," roles, "with," number of years,

174
00:08:08.527 --> 00:08:12.007
"experience doing," accomplishment.

175
00:08:12.007 --> 00:08:15.037
"My greatest strength is," strength,

176
00:08:15.037 --> 00:08:17.947
"and I have a talent for," strength.

177
00:08:17.947 --> 00:08:20.617
"I am passionate about," motivation,

178
00:08:20.617 --> 00:08:23.220
"and I value," value.

179
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:25.297
Here's mine as an example.

180
00:08:25.297 --> 00:08:28.110
"I am a content strategist
and product marketer

181
00:08:28.110 --> 00:08:30.273
with over 10 years of
experience helping businesses

182
00:08:30.273 --> 00:08:33.690
use new technologies to drive success.

183
00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:34.710
My greatest strength

184
00:08:34.710 --> 00:08:38.100
is collaborating and driving
efficiencies across teams

185
00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.590
and I have a talent for crafting stories

186
00:08:40.590 --> 00:08:42.360
and creating marketing programs

187
00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.270
to successfully launch
technology products.

188
00:08:45.270 --> 00:08:47.940
I am passionate about empowering brands

189
00:08:47.940 --> 00:08:50.820
to find and use solutions
that work for them

190
00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:52.528
and helping builders of new technologies

191
00:08:52.528 --> 00:08:56.100
develop even better,
more effective products.

192
00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:59.550
And most importantly, I value having fun

193
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:01.350
and being collaborative, inclusive,

194
00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:03.480
and authentic while I do it."

195
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.540
Now is another good
time to pause the video

196
00:09:06.540 --> 00:09:09.090
and grab that piece of paper or journal

197
00:09:09.090 --> 00:09:11.973
to start working on your
career identity statement.

198
00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:20.250
Remember, your statement
is a work in progress.

199
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.557
You should revisit and refine it

200
00:09:21.557 --> 00:09:25.200
as you gain new experience
and insights about yourself,

201
00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:27.224
like after you complete a
Google Career Certificate,

202
00:09:27.224 --> 00:09:28.830
for example.

203
00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:32.250
So now that you've written
your career identity statement,

204
00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:33.780
what should you do with it?

205
00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.211
Writing your career identity statement

206
00:09:35.211 --> 00:09:39.060
is a powerful way to
add clarity and energy

207
00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.843
to all the other career development tools

208
00:09:40.843 --> 00:09:42.660
you carry with you.

209
00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:45.510
You can incorporate parts
of it into your resume,

210
00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:49.770
LinkedIn profile, cover
letters, and elevator pitch.

211
00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:51.030
This will help you clearly

212
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.670
and consistently communicate
what's important to you

213
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:56.550
and help you stand out from
others in the same field.

214
00:09:56.550 --> 00:09:58.397
It can also guide you
to be more intentional

215
00:09:58.397 --> 00:10:01.380
and purposeful when searching for a job

216
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:03.630
or choosing a career path.

217
00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:06.990
Exploring and creating a strong
career identity for yourself

218
00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:09.750
is a journey that takes time and effort.

219
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:12.090
But trust me, it's worth it.

220
00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:15.030
The more you know about
yourself and what you want,

221
00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:17.580
the better choices you'll
make for your career,

222
00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.650
and as you continue to grow

223
00:10:19.650 --> 00:10:21.600
and strengthen your career identity,

224
00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:24.720
your North Star will shine even brighter,

225
00:10:24.720 --> 00:10:26.550
moving you towards your goals.

226
00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:29.853
Here's to the next step
in your amazing journey.
