00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.346
In this video, we'll discuss how to create
a resume that is tailored to the job

2
00:00:05.346 --> 00:00:06.770
you're applying for.

3
00:00:06.770 --> 00:00:11.757
Note that a resume is sometimes called
a Curriculum Vitae, or CV, for short.

4
00:00:12.757 --> 00:00:16.630
Remember that it's okay if you don't
have any cybersecurity experience.

5
00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:19.944
This certificate program
has covered key skills and

6
00:00:19.944 --> 00:00:26.300
concepts that employers are looking for in
an entry-level security analyst position.

7
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.822
You can mention all that you've learned
in this program on your resume,

8
00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:36.080
including programming languages, such as
Python and SQL, and Linux line-command.

9
00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.967
You can also share your understanding of
what it means to have a security mindset,

10
00:00:41.967 --> 00:00:47.856
your knowledge of standard frameworks and
controls, like the NIST CSF and CIA Triad

11
00:00:47.856 --> 00:00:54.260
model, as well as your familiarity with
how to use SIEM tools and packet sniffers.

12
00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.804
It's also possible that some of your
earlier job experiences allowed you to

13
00:00:58.804 --> 00:01:03.360
develop knowledge and skills that
are transferable to a security role.

14
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.997
These skills could include being
detail oriented, collaborative, and

15
00:01:07.997 --> 00:01:11.680
having strong written and
verbal communication skills.

16
00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:13.880
Here's an example of a resume.

17
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.462
You'll want to start with your
name at the top of the resume,

18
00:01:17.462 --> 00:01:20.330
followed by your professional title.

19
00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:23.834
Your title could be something
like 'Security Analyst' or

20
00:01:23.834 --> 00:01:28.090
a title that matches the position
you're applying for.

21
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.482
You'll also want to include at
least one way that employers or recruiters

22
00:01:32.482 --> 00:01:38.068
can contact you, for example,
an email address or phone number.

23
00:01:39.068 --> 00:01:42.640
After your name and title,
you'll provide a summary statement.

24
00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:44.840
This section should be brief,

25
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.514
just one or two sentences related to
your strengths and relevant skills.

26
00:01:49.514 --> 00:01:54.116
Make sure the statement includes
specific words from the responsibility

27
00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:56.900
section of the job description.

28
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.238
You can include something like this in
your statement:

29
00:02:01.238 --> 00:02:07.265
I am a motivated security analyst seeking an
entry-level cybersecurity position to apply my skills

30
00:02:07.265 --> 00:02:13.520
in network security, security policy,
and organizational risk management.

31
00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.870
Following your name and
summary statement is the skills section.

32
00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:22.446
This is a bulleted list of the skills
you've learned in this program that

33
00:02:22.446 --> 00:02:24.331
are related to the position.

34
00:02:25.331 --> 00:02:28.750
Employers usually like to know about
your previous work experience.

35
00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.484
In the experience section,
you'll list your work history.

36
00:02:32.484 --> 00:02:36.164
Underneath each job entry,
provide a list of the skills and

37
00:02:36.164 --> 00:02:38.950
responsibilities you performed.

38
00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:43.479
It's a good idea to start each
bullet with a verb and, if possible,

39
00:02:43.479 --> 00:02:46.432
details that quantify an accomplishment.

40
00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:52.247
For example: 'Collaborated with a team
of six to develop training for

41
00:02:52.247 --> 00:02:55.262
more than 25 company employees.'

42
00:02:55.262 --> 00:02:59.661
'Try to highlight the security or
technology related skills and

43
00:02:59.661 --> 00:03:04.476
knowledge that you have, based on
your experiences in previous jobs

44
00:03:04.476 --> 00:03:06.729
and this certificate program.'

45
00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.120
The next section of the resume lists
your education and certifications.

46
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.670
Start with the most recent
education you've completed,

47
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:19.965
including certifications, trade schools,
online courses, or college experience.

48
00:03:19.965 --> 00:03:22.133
Also include the names of sites and

49
00:03:22.133 --> 00:03:27.370
organizations that issued your
certifications and schools you attended.

50
00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:31.774
List any subjects you studied related
to the job you're applying for.

51
00:03:31.774 --> 00:03:36.594
If you're currently enrolled in school or
a certification program but

52
00:03:36.594 --> 00:03:39.415
haven't graduated, note: in progress.

53
00:03:40.415 --> 00:03:43.320
As you develop your resume,
keep a couple of things in mind.

54
00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.047
Make sure there are no spelling or

55
00:03:45.047 --> 00:03:49.400
grammatical errors in your resume before
sending it to your potential employer.

56
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.897
Also note that resumes are typically
about two pages long, and

57
00:03:53.897 --> 00:03:57.921
list only your last 10 years or
less of work experience.

58
00:03:58.921 --> 00:04:02.538
Resumes can be created using word
processing applications like

59
00:04:02.538 --> 00:04:04.596
Google Docs or OpenOffice.

60
00:04:04.596 --> 00:04:06.851
However, you might find some simple but

61
00:04:06.851 --> 00:04:10.179
professional resume templates
online to get you started.

62
00:04:10.179 --> 00:04:12.822
To find them, type: free resume template

63

64
00:04:16.410 --> 00:04:21.151
If you use a template, be sure to replace
all of the prefilled text with YOUR

65
00:04:21.151 --> 00:04:24.220
information and qualifications.

66
00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.230
There is so much to consider
when creating your resume.

67
00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:30.616
