[MUSIC]

2
00:00:04.754 --> 00:00:09.236
My name is Garvey, I'm a global
staffing manager here at Google.

3
00:00:09.236 --> 00:00:10.777
I've hired, I would say,

4
00:00:10.777 --> 00:00:15.332
several hundred security engineers here
at Google over the last seven years.

5
00:00:15.332 --> 00:00:17.820
Advice I'd give those
that are preparing for

6
00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.208
their technical interviews, don't expect
that the interview will be a sort of

7
00:00:22.208 --> 00:00:26.732
trivial exam of how many questions can you
answer in this sort of period of time.

8
00:00:26.732 --> 00:00:30.710
I want to know, as an interviewer, does
the candidate understand the fundamentals

9
00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.572
and can they explain them back to me?

10
00:00:32.572 --> 00:00:36.103
Programs and applications that
I would recommend preparing for

11
00:00:36.103 --> 00:00:40.219
when doing an entry level interview,
for example, Splunk, Wireshark,

12
00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:43.710
understanding their functions,
their purpose.

13
00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.572
If you can get to the point of
understanding their internals,

14
00:00:46.572 --> 00:00:47.510
why they exist.

15
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:49.996
If they didn't exist,
how would you solve a problem?

16
00:00:49.996 --> 00:00:50.824
Outside of that,

17
00:00:50.824 --> 00:00:54.485
just understanding the fundamentals of
topics that exist within this space.

18
00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:58.339
Network security, web application,
security knowledge,

19
00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:01.452
operating system internals,
understanding and

20
00:01:01.452 --> 00:01:06.360
mastering security protocols I think
that's an important place to start.

21
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:09.110
Practice answering open end questions.

22
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.134
They tend to be really difficult,
they're ambiguous by design,

23
00:01:12.134 --> 00:01:13.560
they're complex by design.

24
00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.504
You always want to start first
by asking clarifying questions.

25
00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:20.875
Get information from your interviewer
to help you narrow down the focus of

26
00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:25.543
the question itself, but also sort of
lower the scope of the problem, right?

27
00:01:25.543 --> 00:01:27.244
Into something that you
can answer yourself,

28
00:01:27.244 --> 00:01:29.020
that you know that you
feel comfortable with.

29
00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:31.030
Organize your answer
through the STAR method.

30
00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:35.315
It's a great way to organize yourself when
faced with a large open ended question,

31
00:01:35.315 --> 00:01:38.864
it will help your interviewer
understand your train of thought.

32
00:01:38.864 --> 00:01:43.269
Thinking out loud as well will help your
interviewer understand okay, this is where

33
00:01:43.269 --> 00:01:47.220
Garvey's going with this answer,
if I need to help him, I can help him.

34
00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.368
Maybe he doesn't get the entire answer, I
know he was on the right track because he

35
00:01:50.368 --> 00:01:52.756
was thinking out loud,
I understood where he was going.

36
00:01:52.756 --> 00:01:54.244
If you don't know the answer, that's fine.

37
00:01:54.244 --> 00:01:58.705
Again, no one expects you to walk on
water, but we don't expect you to lie,

38
00:01:58.705 --> 00:02:00.456
[LAUGH] if you will, right?

39
00:02:00.456 --> 00:02:03.352
My ideal candidate is someone
who just loves to learn, right?

40
00:02:03.352 --> 00:02:07.682
Someone that's humble, that's honest,
someone that can manage through ambiguity,

41
00:02:07.682 --> 00:02:12.140
complexity in their own life, doesn't
necessarily have to be directly related to

42
00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.556
cybersecurity, but someone that when
faced with a problem, runs towards it.

43
00:02:16.556 --> 00:02:20.552
They're always a student, they're always
there to learn, always there to mentor,

44
00:02:20.552 --> 00:02:24.572
lead others, and they demonstrate those
characteristics throughout their life.

45
00:02:24.572 --> 00:02:28.308
Nerves during technical interviews,
I think that's pretty standard [LAUGH],

46
00:02:28.308 --> 00:02:30.012
it's okay to be nervous, right?

47
00:02:30.012 --> 00:02:31.908
I think it means you care.

48
00:02:31.908 --> 00:02:33.156
There's a reason you're there.

49
00:02:33.156 --> 00:02:36.276
There's a reason you find
yourself in that moment, right?

50
00:02:36.276 --> 00:02:37.684
Someone has counted you in already.

51
00:02:37.684 --> 00:02:40.676
They have belief in you and
this space needs you.

52
00:02:40.676 --> 00:02:46.190
So, you know, I would say, trust yourself,
trust your gut, don't be afraid to fail.
