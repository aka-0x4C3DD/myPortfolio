Let's take a moment to
review what we've covered.

4
00:00:07.945 --> 00:00:09.090
We started by discussing how to

5
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.405

in the security field.

6
00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:16.065
Then, we explored how
to create your resume.

00:00:16.065 --> 00:00:18.630
Next, we shared
some strategies to

8
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.375
develop rapport
with interviewers.

00:00:21.375 --> 00:00:24.060
We also covered how to
use the STAR Method

10
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.090
to answer open-ended interview
questions thoughtfully.

11
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.070
We finished by discussing how

12
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.095
to develop an elevator pitch.

13
00:00:32.095 --> 00:00:32.895

helped you feel

14
00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:34.695
confident as you begin to search

15
00:00:34.695 --> 00:00:39.160
and apply for jobs in the
