1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:02.850
After you've
submitted your resume

2
00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:04.304
to several job postings,

3
00:00:04.304 --> 00:00:07.050
you'll hopefully get an
opportunity for an interview.

4
00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:09.240
The interview process
usually starts

5
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.655
with a short
pre-screening phone call.

6
00:00:11.655 --> 00:00:13.470
It typically involves having

7
00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:16.230
a 15-minute conversation
with a hiring manager

8
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.020
or recruiter who will
ask you some questions to

9
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.125
make sure that you are who
your resume says you are

10
00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:25.230
and that you meet the minimum
requirements for the job.

11
00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:28.500
Following the pre-screening,
you could be invited to

12
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.275
an in-person interview
either on-site or online.

13
00:00:32.275 --> 00:00:35.180
This could be a panel interview
with a few members of

14
00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.800
the team that you
would be working

15
00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.800
with or a one-on-one interview.

16
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.900
Let's discuss some
strategies that

17
00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:44.200
can help prepare you
for an interview.

18
00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.230
Review the job description and
your resume ahead of time.

19
00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.630
Practice speaking
about the experiences

20
00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:53.320
and skills that the
employer is looking for.

21
00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.130
Consider practicing this with

22
00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.280
a friend by participating
in a mock interview.

23
00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.460
Your friend will act as the
interviewer and you will

24
00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.110
answer their questions, as

25
00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:05.155
if you're meeting
with the employer.

26
00:01:06.155 --> 00:01:08.480
It can also be helpful to
dress professionally and

27
00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:09.890
feel comfortable
in the clothes you

28
00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.275
choose to wear for
the interview.

29
00:01:13.275 --> 00:01:14.790
Before the interview begins,

30
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:16.720
take a few deep breaths,

31
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.865
and remind yourself of all
the preparation you've done.

32
00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:23.260
If the interview is online
via video conference,

33
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:25.690
prepare a location
in your home that is

34
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.405
quiet, tidy, and professional.

35
00:01:28.405 --> 00:01:32.170
Also be sure to test your
video and audio settings,

36
00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.610
and if necessary, download

37
00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:35.425
the video conference application

38
00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:37.660
specified by the interviewer.

39
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.910
This will help ensure
that you correct

40
00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.790
any technical issues
before the interview.

41
00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:45.880
Interviews usually
include two parts:

42
00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:48.985
a background interview and
a technical interview.

43
00:01:49.985 --> 00:01:51.310
The background
interview will likely

44
00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:54.115
include questions
about your education,

45
00:01:54.115 --> 00:01:57.515
work experience,
skills, and abilities.

46
00:01:57.515 --> 00:01:58.940
You might even be asked

47
00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:02.195
some personal questions
unrelated to the job posting.

48
00:02:02.195 --> 00:02:05.570
The interviewer is trying to
get to know you, to determine

49
00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:07.130
if you'll be a good match for

50
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.185
the team and company culture.

51
00:02:09.185 --> 00:02:10.730
At the same time,

52
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.580
you want to ask questions
to help you decide if

53
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.780
the team and company culture
are a good match for you.

54
00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.000
The other portion
of the interview

55
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.715
is the technical interview.

56
00:02:21.715 --> 00:02:24.050
This is when the
interviewer will ask you

57
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.645
specific questions
about technical skills

58
00:02:26.645 --> 00:02:28.205
related to the role.

59
00:02:28.205 --> 00:02:29.960
You might be asked,
how you would

60
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:32.450
respond to a specific situation,

61
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:34.729
or to explain a
technical concept

62
00:02:34.729 --> 00:02:36.665
that's listed on your resume.

63
00:02:36.665 --> 00:02:39.500
Do your best to answer
these types of questions

64
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:42.100
confidently and concisely based

65
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:44.030
on your current knowledge.

66
00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:47.180
It's okay to say that you
don't know the answer to

67
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:49.460
a question or that
you need a moment

68
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:52.325
to respond, so you can
think about your answer.

69
00:02:52.325 --> 00:02:55.020
Employers respect honesty.

70
00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.390
Just follow up with

71
00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:59.585
an explanation of how you
would figure out the answer,

72
00:02:59.585 --> 00:03:03.470
either by researching it or
collaborating with the team.

73
00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:06.605
Even after you've completed
this certificate program,

74
00:03:06.605 --> 00:03:09.475
you'll still have access
to all of the content.

75
00:03:09.475 --> 00:03:13.520
So before the interview, go
back and review your notes,

76
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.825
the glossary,

77
00:03:14.825 --> 00:03:16.400
and any concepts that you

78
00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.530
might need to refresh
your memory on.

79
00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.300
This can help you feel prepared

80
00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.220
for the questions
you'll be asked.

81
00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.230
Remember, you can prepare for

82
00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:27.470
the interview by participating
in a mock interview,

83
00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:29.510
reviewing the job description,

84
00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.310
and taking a few deep breaths

85
00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:33.370
before the interview begins.

86
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.830
You've learned a lot in this
course and are ready to move

87
00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:40.835
ahead and find a position
as a security analyst.

88
00:03:40.835 --> 00:03:42.950
Coming up, we'll discuss how

89
00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:46.290
to conduct
pre-interview research.
