00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:05.118
Now you've had an opportunity to learn
about the essential role you'll be playing

2
00:00:05.118 --> 00:00:06.470
by escalating incidents.

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.670
Let's review what we covered
in this section of the course.

4
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:12.767
We started off by defining
incident escalation and

5
00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:16.890
discussing useful traits needed
to properly escalate incidents.

6
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:20.452
We also explored a few incident
classification types and

7
00:00:20.452 --> 00:00:23.290
their potential impacts to an organization.

8
00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:27.300
From there, we discussed how small
security incidents can become

9
00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.350
bigger problems if not properly addressed.

10
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.212
Finally, we covered some
general guidelines for

11
00:00:33.212 --> 00:00:36.500
the actual process of incident escalation.

12
00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.195
This process varies depending on
the organization you work for,

13
00:00:40.195 --> 00:00:44.910
but one thing should always remain
the same: Your attention to detail!

14
00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.097
Understanding how each
incident affects the data and

15
00:00:48.097 --> 00:00:51.013
assets of an organization
is really important,

16
00:00:51.013 --> 00:00:56.200
because the decisions you make can affect
the entire security team and organization.

17
00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.520
Are you ready to continue
your security journey?!

18
00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.191
Coming up we'll discuss stakeholders and
how to communicate effectively with them.
