00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.454
We've shared quite a bit about the
importance of your role when it comes to

2
00:00:05.454 --> 00:00:06.966
escalating incidents.

3
00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:11.686
We've even discussed a few incident
types that you may encounter.

4
00:00:11.686 --> 00:00:16.940
But what are the actual steps you need to
take to properly escalate an incident?

5
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:19.894
The answer to that question actually
depends on the organization

6
00:00:19.894 --> 00:00:21.450
you're working for.

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:24.251
There isn't a set standard or process for

8
00:00:24.251 --> 00:00:27.710
incident escalation that
all organizations use.

9
00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.884
Every security team has
their own processes and

10
00:00:30.884 --> 00:00:34.224
procedures when it comes
to handling incidents.

11
00:00:35.224 --> 00:00:37.687
In this video, we're going to
discuss general guidelines for

12
00:00:37.687 --> 00:00:41.230
incident escalation and
how to apply them on the job.

13
00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.016
Let's get started!

14
00:00:44.016 --> 00:00:46.980
Each organization has its own process for
handling security incidents.

15
00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.949
That process is known as
an escalation policy,

16
00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:53.958
which is a set of actions that
outline who should be notified when

17
00:00:53.958 --> 00:00:58.281
an incident alert occurs and
how that incident should be handled.

18
00:00:59.281 --> 00:01:02.328
Ideally, the escalation process
would go smoothly every time.

19
00:01:02.328 --> 00:01:07.780
But in the workplace, challenges to
that process can happen unexpectedly.

20
00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:12.080
For example, what if your immediate
supervisor is out of office?

21
00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.250
If an incident occurs that day,
it still needs to be escalated to someone.

22
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.898
This is one example of why understanding
your organization's escalation policy is

23
00:01:21.898 --> 00:01:23.140
important.

24
00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.383
You don't need to memorize your
organization's escalation policy, but

25
00:01:27.383 --> 00:01:30.410
it is wise to save or
bookmark it on your work device.

26
00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:34.370
This way, you'll always have
access to it when you need it.

27
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.524
Following an organization's escalation
policy is essential, because

28
00:01:38.524 --> 00:01:41.707
the actions you take help
protect the organization and

29
00:01:41.707 --> 00:01:44.360
the people it serves
from malicious actors.

30
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.679
The escalation policy for an organization
can be an extensive document.

31
00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:51.580
So it's up to you to pay
attention to the small details

32
00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.640
within the escalation policy
of your organization.

33
00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.346
Attention to detail can make the
difference between escalating an incident

34
00:01:59.346 --> 00:02:01.200
to the right or wrong person.

35
00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:05.216
It can also help you prioritize
which incidents need to be

36
00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:08.570
escalated with more or less urgency.

37
00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:12.773
Every organization handles incident
escalation differently, but

38
00:02:12.773 --> 00:02:16.691
analysts need to ensure that
incidents are handled correctly.

39
00:02:17.691 --> 00:02:19.404
Great work expanding
your security mindset!
