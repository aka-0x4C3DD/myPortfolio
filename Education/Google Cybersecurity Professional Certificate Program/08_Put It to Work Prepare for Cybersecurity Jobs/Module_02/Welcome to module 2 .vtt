00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.750
I'm excited that you
could join me today!

2
00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.730
Previously, you learned about

3
00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:08.085
the importance of
various asset types.

4
00:00:08.085 --> 00:00:10.230
You also learned about
the relationship

5
00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.780
between incidents and events.

6
00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.230
Now, we'll focus on
escalating those incidents

7
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.295
and events to the right people.

8
00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:20.760
Protecting the
data and assets of

9
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.615
an organization is the primary
goal of a security team.

10
00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:27.180
The decisions you
make every day are

11
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:28.290
important for helping

12
00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:30.735
the security team
achieve that goal.

13
00:00:31.735 --> 00:00:33.120
Recognizing when and how to

14
00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.090
escalate security
incidents is crucial.

15
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.640
It helps ensure simple issues

16
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.775
don't become larger problems
for an organization.

17
00:00:41.775 --> 00:00:43.490
Escalation is a term you

18
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:45.580
should familiarize
yourself with.

19
00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.680
It's likely to resurface
often as you

20
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.605
continue your journey into
the security profession.

21
00:00:52.605 --> 00:00:53.270
In the following videos,

22
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.280
we'll discuss incident
escalation from

23
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:57.634
an entry-level
analyst's perspective.

24
00:00:57.634 --> 00:00:59.330
Then, we'll explore

25
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:01.730
various incident
classification types

26
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:03.650
and the impacts
security incidents

27
00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.555
can have on business operations.

28
00:01:05.555 --> 00:01:06.860
Finally, we'll share

29
00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.850
some general guidelines
for escalating incidents.

30
00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:11.810
Coming up, we'll start by

31
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.880
focusing on incident escalation

32
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.470
and how it can be
used to prevent

33
00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.750
a seemingly small
issue from becoming

34
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:21.320
a bigger problem.
Let's get started!
