00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.455
So far, we've discussed
different incident types

2
00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:06.330
and the importance of escalating

3
00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.505
those incidents to
the right person.

4
00:00:08.505 --> 00:00:10.470
But what happens if an incident

5
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:12.975
goes unescalated for too long?

6
00:00:13.975 --> 00:00:16.740
In this video, we'll discuss
the potential impact that

7
00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.900
even the smallest
incident can have on

8
00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:23.185
an organization, if it goes
unnoticed. Are you ready?

9
00:00:23.185 --> 00:00:26.040
Great! Now let's take a journey

10
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:29.175
into a day in the life of an
organization's security team.

11
00:00:30.175 --> 00:00:32.175
It's been a quiet day
for the security team.

12
00:00:32.175 --> 00:00:34.475
Suddenly, you notice
there's been

13
00:00:34.475 --> 00:00:36.530
unusual log activity in an app

14
00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.080
that was recently banned
from the organization.

15
00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.090
You make a note to mention

16
00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:42.140
this activity during

17
00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.335
the next meeting with
your supervisor.

18
00:00:44.335 --> 00:00:47.490
But you forget, and
never mention it.

19
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:49.980
Following this same scenario,

20
00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.635
let's fast forward
to a week later.

21
00:00:52.635 --> 00:00:55.735
You and your supervisor
are meeting again.

22
00:00:55.735 --> 00:00:57.770
But now, the supervisor

23
00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:00.440
indicates that a data
breach has occurred.

24
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.510
This breach has impacted one of

25
00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.225
the manufacturing sites
for the organization.

26
00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:07.340
Now, all operations at

27
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.875
the manufacturing site
have been put on hold.

28
00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:14.075
This causes the company to
lose money and precious time.

29
00:01:14.075 --> 00:01:16.730
Days later, the security team

30
00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:18.515
discovers that the data breach

31
00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:20.810
began with suspicious
activity in

32
00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.035
the app that was recently
banned from the organization.

33
00:01:25.035 --> 00:01:26.960
What we've learned from
this scenario is that

34
00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.970
a simple incident can lead to

35
00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.765
a much larger issue, if
not escalated properly.

36
00:01:32.765 --> 00:01:36.805
Incident criticality is also
important to note here.

37
00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:39.245
Initially an incident can be

38
00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:42.380
escalated with a medium
level of criticality if

39
00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:45.035
the analyst doesn't
have enough information

40
00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:46.340
to determine the amount of

41
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.530
damage done to the organization.

42
00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.200
Once an experienced
incident handler

43
00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:52.610
reviews the incident,

44
00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:54.770
the incident may be increased or

45
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.180
decreased to a high or
low criticality level.

46
00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:00.230
Every security incident you

47
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:03.155
encounter is important
to an organization,

48
00:02:03.155 --> 00:02:06.950
but some incidents are certainly
more urgent than others.

49
00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.170
So, what's the best way to determine

50
00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.540
the urgency of a
security incident?

51
00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.715
It really depends on the asset

52
00:02:13.715 --> 00:02:16.170
or assets that the
incident affects.

53
00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.350
For example, if an employee

54
00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.200
forgets their login password
for their work computer,

55
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.080
a low-level security
incident may be

56
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.145
prompted if they have repeated
failed login attempts.

57
00:02:28.145 --> 00:02:30.680
This incident needs
to be addressed,

58
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.935
but the impact of this
incident is likely minimal.

59
00:02:34.935 --> 00:02:36.560
In other instances, assets are

60
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.560
critical to an organization's
business operations,

61
00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:41.525
such as a manufacturing plant

62
00:02:41.525 --> 00:02:44.150
or database that stores PII.

63
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.580
These types of assets need to be

64
00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.145
protected with a higher
level of urgency.

65
00:02:50.145 --> 00:02:51.455
The impact of an
attacker gaining

66
00:02:51.455 --> 00:02:54.500
unauthorized access to a
manufacturing application

67
00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.050
or PII is far greater than

68
00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.600
a forgotten password,
because the attacker

69
00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.615
could interfere with the
manufacturing processes

70
00:03:02.615 --> 00:03:05.380
or expose private
customer data.

71
00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.625
I hope this video has helped you

72
00:03:07.625 --> 00:03:09.500
understand the importance of

73
00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:11.120
knowing the relationship between

74
00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.670
assets and security incidents.

75
00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.500
Later in this
course, we'll share

76
00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:17.375
some new concepts related to

77
00:03:17.375 --> 00:03:20.000
escalation timing
and why your role

78
00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.380
in that process matters.
