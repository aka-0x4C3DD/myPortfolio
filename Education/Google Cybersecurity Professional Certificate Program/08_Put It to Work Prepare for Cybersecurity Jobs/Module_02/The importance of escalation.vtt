00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:02.820
Security analysts are hired to

2
00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:05.280
protect company assets and data,

3
00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.560
including knowing when and

4
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:09.944
how to escalate
security incidents.

5
00:00:09.944 --> 00:00:12.060
In this video, we'll define

6
00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.820
security incident
escalation and discuss

7
00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:17.190
your role in making
decisions that help protect

8
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.505
your organization's
data and assets.

9
00:00:21.505 --> 00:00:23.490
So what is incident escalation? And

10
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.595
why is it so important for
security professionals?

11
00:00:26.595 --> 00:00:29.280
Incident escalation
is the process of

12
00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.130
identifying a potential
security incident,

13
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.555
triaging it, and (if appropriate)

14
00:00:35.555 --> 00:00:38.740
handing it off to a more
experienced team member.

15
00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.330
It's important to
also recognize that

16
00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:44.090
not every incident
needs to be escalated.

17
00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.130
In this video, we'll cover

18
00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.104
what types of incidents
should be escalated.

19
00:00:50.104 --> 00:00:52.760
As an entry-level analyst,
it's unlikely that

20
00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:56.180
you'll be responding to security
incidents independently.

21
00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.080
However, it's important that
you know how to evaluate and

22
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:02.585
escalate incidents to
the right individual

23
00:01:02.585 --> 00:01:04.624
or team when necessary.

24
00:01:04.624 --> 00:01:07.220
Let's discuss the
essential skills needed to

25
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:09.874
properly escalate
security incidents.

26
00:01:10.874 --> 00:01:12.560
There are two essential
skills that will help you

27
00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:16.070
identify security incidents
that need to be escalated:

28
00:01:16.070 --> 00:01:19.510
attention to detail and
an ability to follow

29
00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:23.290
an organization's escalation
guidelines or processes.

30
00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:27.220
Attention to detail will help
you quickly identify when

31
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.870
something doesn't
seem right within

32
00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.735
the organization's
network or systems.

33
00:01:31.735 --> 00:01:35.470
Following a company's escalation
guidelines or processes

34
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.405
will help you know
how to properly

35
00:01:37.405 --> 00:01:39.775
escalate the issue
you've identified.

36
00:01:40.775 --> 00:01:42.520
Larger organizations'
security teams have

37
00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.995
many levels, and each level,

38
00:01:44.995 --> 00:01:46.990
or member, of that team plays

39
00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:50.365
a major role in protecting the
company's assets and data.

40
00:01:50.365 --> 00:01:54.085
However, smaller and
medium sized companies have

41
00:01:54.085 --> 00:01:55.840
only one or two people

42
00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.675
responsible for the
organization's security.

43
00:01:58.675 --> 00:02:00.500
For now, we'll focus on

44
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.585
the roles in bigger
organizations.

45
00:02:03.585 --> 00:02:05.360
From the Chief Information
Security Officer,

46
00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:07.100
also known as the CISO,

47
00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.340
to the engineering team,
public relations team,

48
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.960
and even the legal team,

49
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.055
every member of the
security team matters.

50
00:02:15.055 --> 00:02:17.330
Each team member's
role depends on

51
00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.915
the nature and scope
of the incident.

52
00:02:19.915 --> 00:02:22.460
These roles are
highlighted within

53
00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.770
a company's escalation process.

54
00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:27.140
Even the smallest
security incident can

55
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:30.100
become a much larger
issue if not addressed.

56
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:32.210
And that's where you come in!

57
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:34.595
Imagine you're
working at your desk

58
00:02:34.595 --> 00:02:37.400
and notice what appears
to be a minor incident,

59
00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:38.900
but you decide to take a break

60
00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.155
before addressing
or escalating it.

61
00:02:41.155 --> 00:02:44.705
This decision could have
major consequences.

62
00:02:44.705 --> 00:02:47.975
If a small issue goes
unescalated for too long,

63
00:02:47.975 --> 00:02:49.610
it has the potential to become

64
00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.580
a larger problem that
costs the company money,

65
00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:54.965
exposes sensitive customer data,

66
00:02:54.965 --> 00:02:57.500
or damages the
company's reputation.

67
00:02:57.500 --> 00:02:59.840
However, with a high-level of

68
00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.810
attention to detail, and
an ability to follow

69
00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.045
your organization's
escalation guidelines

70
00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:06.980
and processes, it may be

71
00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:08.390
possible to avoid exposing

72
00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:11.740
the business, and its customers,
to harmful incidents.

73
00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:13.760
As an entry-level analyst,

74
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.740
you play an important role.

75
00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.065
You help the security
team identify

76
00:03:18.065 --> 00:03:20.210
issues within the network and

77
00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:22.190
systems and help make sure

78
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.570
the right person on the team is

79
00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.640
alerted when incidents occur.

80
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:27.905
Think about an assembly line.

81
00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:31.250
Would the final step in the
line be negatively impacted

82
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:34.705
if the first step were done
incorrectly, or not at all?

83
00:03:34.705 --> 00:03:36.315
Of course it would!

84
00:03:36.315 --> 00:03:38.210
Every decision you make helps

85
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.430
the entire security team protect

86
00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.280
an organization's
assets and data.

87
00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.210
Knowing when and how to
escalate security incidents

88
00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.340
is one of many
important decisions

89
00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:51.845
you'll need to make
on a daily basis.

90
00:03:52.845 --> 00:03:53.690
Later in this course,

91
00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:56.960
we'll discuss the various
levels of security incidents.

92
00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:00.065
Knowing those levels will help
you determine the level of

93
00:04:00.065 --> 00:04:04.500
urgency needed to escalate
different incident types.
