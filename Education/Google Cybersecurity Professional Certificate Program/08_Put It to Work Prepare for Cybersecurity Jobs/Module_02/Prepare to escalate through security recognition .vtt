00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.060
Previously, we defined what

2
00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.130
it means to escalate
an incident.

3
00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.410
We also discussed
the skills needed to

4
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:10.515
properly escalate incidents
when the time comes.

5
00:00:11.515 --> 00:00:12.720
In this video, we're
going to cover

6
00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.765
a few incident classification
types to be aware of:

7
00:00:16.765 --> 00:00:18.525
malware infection,

8
00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:21.990
unauthorized access,
and improper usage.

9
00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:24.660
A malware infection
is the incident type

10
00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:26.820
that occurs when malicious
software designed to

11
00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.100
disrupt a system infiltrates

12
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:31.860
an organization's
computers or network.

13
00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:34.155
As discussed in a
previous course,

14
00:00:34.155 --> 00:00:37.170
malware infections can
come in many forms.

15
00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.060
Some are simple and others
are a bit more complex.

16
00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.640
One example is a
phishing attempt.

17
00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.460
These are relatively
simple malware infections.

18
00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.980
Another example is a
ransomware attack,

19
00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:51.775
which is considered
much more complex.

20
00:00:52.775 --> 00:00:53.720
Malware infections can cause

21
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.260
a system's network to run
an unusually low speeds.

22
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.090
Attackers can even prevent

23
00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:01.520
an organization from
viewing critical data,

24
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.470
unless the organization pays

25
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.415
the attacker a ransom
to unlock the data.

26
00:01:06.415 --> 00:01:08.660
This incident type is especially

27
00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:11.030
impactful to an
organization because of

28
00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.190
the amount of sensitive
data stored on

29
00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:16.190
an organization's
network and computers.

30
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.290
Escalating malware infections is

31
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.940
an important aspect of

32
00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.475
protecting the organization
that you work for.

33
00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:24.850
But wait, there's more.

34
00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:26.780
The second incident type we'll

35
00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.945
discuss is unauthorized access.

36
00:01:29.945 --> 00:01:31.670
This is an incident type that

37
00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:33.380
occurs when an individual gains

38
00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.630
digital or physical access to

39
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.530
a system or application
without permission.

40
00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:40.310
As you may recall,

41
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.625
earlier in the program, we
discussed brute force attacks,

42
00:01:43.625 --> 00:01:46.715
which use trial and error
to compromise passwords,

43
00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:49.780
login credentials,
and encryption keys.

44
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.835
These attacks are often
used to help attackers gain

45
00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:54.350
unauthorized access to an

46
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.440
organization's systems
or applications.

47
00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.380
All unauthorized
access incidents

48
00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.275
are important to escalate.

49
00:02:02.275 --> 00:02:06.200
However, the urgency of that
escalation depends on how

50
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.760
critical that system is to

51
00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:10.460
the organization's
business operations.

52
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.990
We'll explore this idea in

53
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:14.500
more detail later
in this course.

54
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.425
The third incident we'll
discuss is improper usage.

55
00:02:18.425 --> 00:02:22.100
This is an incident type that
occurs when an employee of

56
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:23.750
an organization violates

57
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.900
the organization's
acceptable use policies.

58
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:29.465
This one can be a
bit complicated.

59
00:02:29.465 --> 00:02:33.640
There are instances when
improper usage is unintentional.

60
00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:36.020
For an example, an employee may

61
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:38.240
attempt to access
software licenses for

62
00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:40.220
personal use or even use

63
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:44.425
a company's system to access a
friend's or coworker's data.

64
00:02:44.425 --> 00:02:46.400
Maybe the employee
wasn't aware of

65
00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.440
the policy they were violating,

66
00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.720
or maybe the policy
wasn't properly

67
00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.750
defined and communicated
to employees.

68
00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.205
But there are other times when

69
00:02:55.205 --> 00:02:58.420
improper usage is
an intentional act.

70
00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:00.860
So how do you know if an
improper usage incident

71
00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.990
is accidental or intentional?

72
00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.945
That can be a difficult
decision to make.

73
00:03:05.945 --> 00:03:08.675
That's why improper
usage incidents should

74
00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:11.285
always be escalated
to a supervisor.

75
00:03:12.285 --> 00:03:14.315
As a member of an
organization's security team,

76
00:03:14.315 --> 00:03:16.040
it's likely that
you'll encounter

77
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.060
a variety of incident
types while on the job.

78
00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.930
So it's important to know what they

79
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:24.060
are and how to escalate them.
