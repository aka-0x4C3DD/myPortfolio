00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:06.884
The ability to communicate threats,
risks, vulnerabilities, or incidents and

2
00:00:06.884 --> 00:00:11.720
possible solutions is a valuable skill for
security professionals.

3
00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:16.467
In this video, we'll focus on various
communication strategies that can help

4
00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:20.940
you engage with and
convey key ideas to stakeholders.

5
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:22.940
Let's start with visuals.

6
00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:27.422
The use of visuals to tell a security
story can help you communicate

7
00:00:27.422 --> 00:00:29.440
impactful data and metrics.

8
00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:32.823
Charts and
graphs are particularly helpful for this.

9
00:00:32.823 --> 00:00:38.592
They can be used to compare data points or
show small parts of a larger issue.

10
00:00:38.592 --> 00:00:39.568
Using relevant and

11
00:00:39.568 --> 00:00:43.716
detailed graphics can help you develop
the story you want to tell stakeholders, so

12
00:00:43.716 --> 00:00:47.198
they can make decisions that would
help protect the organization.

13
00:00:48.198 --> 00:00:51.418
While visuals are a compelling way
to capture the attention of your

14
00:00:51.418 --> 00:00:55.259
stakeholders, some issues
are best explained in an email or

15
00:00:55.259 --> 00:00:57.200
even a phone call.

16
00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.290
Be mindful of the sensitive
information contained in these types

17
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.635
of communications.

18
00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:04.131
For security purposes,

19
00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:08.890
it's important to communicate
sensitive information with care.

20
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:14.058
Be sure to follow the procedures outlined
in your organization's playbooks and

21
00:01:14.058 --> 00:01:18.998
always make sure to send emails to the
right email recipient, as it could create

22
00:01:18.998 --> 00:01:23.730
a risk if the wrong person receives
confidential security information.

23
00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:30.540
One challenging thing about emails is the
potentially long wait time for response.

24
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.530
Stakeholders have many responsibilities.

25
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.533
This means they may
sometimes miss an email, or

26
00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:39.760
fail to respond in a timely manner.

27
00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:46.420
In these instances, a simple phone call or
instant message may be a better option.

28
00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.664
My experience in security has taught me
that sometimes a simple instant message or

29
00:01:51.664 --> 00:01:55.070
call can help move a situation forward.

30
00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.289
Direct communication is often better
than waiting days or weeks for

31
00:01:59.289 --> 00:02:03.297
an email response to an issue that
requires immediate attention.

32
00:02:03.297 --> 00:02:08.292
When appropriate, take the initiative
to follow up with a stakeholder if they

33
00:02:08.292 --> 00:02:11.557
haven't responded to
an email in a timely manner.

34
00:02:11.557 --> 00:02:12.862
It sounds simple, but

35
00:02:12.862 --> 00:02:17.540
a friendly call can often prevent
a major issue from occurring.

36
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:21.365
It's important to stand out
in the security profession,

37
00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:25.910
especially if you don't have
previous experience in the industry.

38
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.889
Visual representations, emails, and
phone calls are great ways to showcase

39
00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:34.680
your written and
verbal communication skills.

40
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.100
The visual aspect shows your
ability to put metrics and

41
00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.870
data together in an impactful way.

42
00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.674
If you don't receive a timely
response from a stakeholder,

43
00:02:44.674 --> 00:02:46.771
following up shows initiative.
