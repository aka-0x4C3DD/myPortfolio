00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.730
You've had an opportunity to

2
00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:04.530
learn about the important role

3
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:06.900
stakeholders play
and different ways

4
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.580
to communicate with them.

5
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.755
Let's review what we covered.

6
00:00:11.755 --> 00:00:13.485
We started by
defining stakeholders

7
00:00:13.485 --> 00:00:16.710
and their roles in
protecting an organization.

8
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.300
We also explored

9
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.940
the sensitive nature
of communications with

10
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.520
stakeholders and the
importance of sharing

11
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.015
that information with
care and confidentiality.

12
00:00:27.015 --> 00:00:29.670
Then, we discussed
information that

13
00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:32.235
needs to be communicated
to stakeholders.

14
00:00:32.235 --> 00:00:35.745
After all, stakeholders
are extremely busy,

15
00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:37.350
so we only want to share

16
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:40.855
relevant information that
they need to be aware of.

17
00:00:40.855 --> 00:00:43.490
We ended our discussion by

18
00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.400
introducing various
communications strategies,

19
00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:49.925
including emails, phone
calls, and visual dashboards.

20
00:00:50.925 --> 00:00:52.505
Understanding who
the stakeholders

21
00:00:52.505 --> 00:00:55.010
are within your
organization and how to

22
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.470
communicate with them,
will help you throughout

23
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:00.575
your career as a
security professional.

24
00:01:01.575 --> 00:01:03.350
Be intentional about
the strategies

25
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.090
you use to communicate.

26
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:07.280
Remove unnecessary details from

27
00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:08.900
your communications, and be

28
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.970
specific and precise when

29
00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.475
relaying information
to stakeholders.

30
00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:16.250
Stakeholders are
depending on you,

31
00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.610
as a story-teller, to tell
them the security story,

32
00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.470
or the potential issues and

33
00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:23.615
solutions, in a way
that makes sense.

34
00:01:23.615 --> 00:01:25.700
The communication strategies we

35
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.160
discussed will
help you stand out

36
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:29.900
as someone who has
a combination of

37
00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:32.735
technical and
transferable skills.

38
00:01:33.735 --> 00:01:34.790
Coming up, your instructor for

39
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.400
the final sections of
this course, Emily,

40
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.710
will discuss a few
ways to engage with

41
00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.780
the security
community and how to

42
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.900
find and apply for jobs
in the security field.
