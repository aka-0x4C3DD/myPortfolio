00:00:01.577 --> 00:00:04.241
We've covered so much in previous courses,

2
00:00:04.241 --> 00:00:08.589
from the foundations of security to
a basic understanding of networks and

3
00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:11.481
programming languages like SQL and
Python.

4
00:00:11.481 --> 00:00:14.659
These concepts are core
knowledge when preparing for

5
00:00:14.659 --> 00:00:16.783
a role in the security profession.

6
00:00:16.783 --> 00:00:20.518
But how does this information help
you on a day-to-day basis?

7
00:00:20.518 --> 00:00:23.282
And to whom do you communicate
this information?

8
00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:27.506
In this course, we'll start by
discussing who stakeholders are.

9
00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:31.361
Then, we'll identify their
roles in relation to security.

10
00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:35.217
Finally, we'll share effective
communication strategies for

11
00:00:35.217 --> 00:00:37.888
relaying key information to stakeholders.

12
00:00:38.888 --> 00:00:40.928
But before we can communicate
with stakeholders,

13
00:00:40.928 --> 00:00:44.685
we have to understand who they are and
why they're important.

14
00:00:44.685 --> 00:00:45.873
So let's get started!
