00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:02.705
Welcome back!

2
00:00:02.705 --> 00:00:05.160
Previously, we discussed stakeholders and

3
00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:06.810
the important
security roles they

4
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:09.210
play within an organization.

5
00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:12.120
Now, let's explore the role you

6
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.330
play in communicating
with those stakeholders.

7
00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:17.850
The information that's
communicated to

8
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.045
stakeholders is sensitive.
For example,

9
00:00:21.045 --> 00:00:22.530
if you send an email to

10
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.185
stakeholders about a
recent security breach,

11
00:00:25.185 --> 00:00:27.600
it's important to be mindful of

12
00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.915
what you communicate and
who you communicate to.

13
00:00:30.915 --> 00:00:33.270
Different stakeholders
may need to be

14
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.565
informed about different issues.

15
00:00:35.565 --> 00:00:38.550
As a result, your
communications with them

16
00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.875
need to be clear,
concise, and focused.

17
00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:45.500
Security is a detail-driven
profession,

18
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.810
so it's essential that
you stay mindful of

19
00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.615
the details when sending
your communications.

20
00:00:51.615 --> 00:00:53.450
Stakeholders are
very busy people.

21
00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.415
Your communication
should be precise,

22
00:00:56.415 --> 00:00:59.145
avoid unnecessary
technical terms,

23
00:00:59.145 --> 00:01:01.155
and have a clear purpose.

24
00:01:01.155 --> 00:01:03.770
You don't want them to
have to guess the reason

25
00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:06.755
for your email or why
it matters to them.

26
00:01:06.755 --> 00:01:09.590
To help with this,
ask your manager or

27
00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.410
immediate supervisors
questions to find out

28
00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:15.995
what the stakeholders you
communicate with need to know.

29
00:01:16.995 --> 00:01:18.890
As you may recall, earlier

30
00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.280
we discussed what it means
to have a security mindset.

31
00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.560
A part of that
mindset means asking

32
00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:27.535
questions about the assets
and data you're protecting.

33
00:01:27.535 --> 00:01:30.260
For example, you could ask:

34
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.510
What's the most
important data to

35
00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.090
protect on a daily basis?

36
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.580
Or, what security tool has been
most important or

37
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.565
useful to protect
our data and assets?

38
00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:43.115
Having a security
mindset also means

39
00:01:43.115 --> 00:01:45.995
understanding what matters
most to stakeholders,

40
00:01:45.995 --> 00:01:48.740
so you know what information
to share with them.

41
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.500
Effective communication
involves relaying

42
00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.000
only the information that is

43
00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.625
most relevant to stakeholders.

44
00:01:56.625 --> 00:01:58.445
Staying informed
about security issues

45
00:01:58.445 --> 00:02:01.625
helps stakeholders do their
jobs more effectively.

46
00:02:01.625 --> 00:02:03.680
Your role in communicating with

47
00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.595
stakeholders is to help them
obtain that information.

48
00:02:07.595 --> 00:02:09.935
This is yet another
example of how

49
00:02:09.935 --> 00:02:13.415
essential your role is
within a security team.

50
00:02:14.415 --> 00:02:16.580
Coming up, we'll discuss
the information that is

51
00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.490
most important to communicate
with stakeholders.
