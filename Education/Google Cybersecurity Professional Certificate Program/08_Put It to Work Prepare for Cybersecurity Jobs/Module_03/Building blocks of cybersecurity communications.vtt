00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.620
Previously, we discussed
communicating information

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:06.675
that is important
to stakeholders.

3
00:00:06.675 --> 00:00:08.820
It's essential that
communications are

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:11.040
specific and clear, so

5
00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.245
stakeholders understand
what's happening

6
00:00:13.245 --> 00:00:15.780
and what actions may
need to be taken.

7
00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:18.810
In this video, we'll go
into more detail about

8
00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.365
how to create precise and
clear communications.

9
00:00:23.365 --> 00:00:25.260
Creating security
communications to share with

10
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.665
stakeholders is similar
to telling a great story.

11
00:00:28.665 --> 00:00:33.105
Stories typically have a
beginning, middle, and end.

12
00:00:33.105 --> 00:00:35.660
Somewhere in that story
there is some sort of

13
00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:38.780
conflict and an
eventual resolution.

14
00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:41.390
This concept is also true when

15
00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.205
telling security stories
to stakeholders.

16
00:00:45.205 --> 00:00:46.430
The security story details

17
00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.530
what the security challenge is,

18
00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.675
how it impacts the organization,

19
00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:53.255
and possible solutions
to the issue.

20
00:00:53.255 --> 00:00:55.850
The security story also includes

21
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:58.325
data related to the challenge,

22
00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:01.370
its impact and
proposed solutions.

23
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.400
This data could be in the form
of reports that summarize

24
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.380
key findings or a list of

25
00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.250
issues that may need
immediate attention.

26
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:12.595
Let's use the following
scenario as an example.

27
00:01:12.595 --> 00:01:15.310
You've been monitoring
system logs and

28
00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.020
notice possible
malicious code execution

29
00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.340
in the logs that can lead to

30
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:23.740
the exposure of sensitive
user information.

31
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.790
Now, you need to communicate

32
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.695
what is happening
to a stakeholder,

33
00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:30.425
in this case, your
immediate supervisor.

34
00:01:30.425 --> 00:01:33.575
The first step is to
detail the issue:

35
00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:36.560
potential malicious
code execution

36
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.125
found while monitoring the logs.

37
00:01:39.125 --> 00:01:41.210
The next step is to refer to

38
00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:44.390
the organization's incident
response playbook, and

39
00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.340
mention the suggested
guidance from

40
00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.650
the playbook regarding
malicious code

41
00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:50.440
found in system logs.

42
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.130
This shows your supervisor

43
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:53.510
that you've been
paying attention to

44
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:56.885
the procedures already
established by the team.

45
00:01:56.885 --> 00:01:59.600
The final piece of your story is

46
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.335
to provide a possible
solution to the issue.

47
00:02:03.335 --> 00:02:04.910
In this scenario, you may not be

48
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:08.090
the final decision maker
regarding what action is taken,

49
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.270
but you've explained to
the stakeholder what

50
00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:14.690
has happened and a possible
solution to the problem.

51
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.075
You can communicate the story

52
00:02:17.075 --> 00:02:19.585
we just discussed
in various ways.

53
00:02:19.585 --> 00:02:22.475
Send an email, share a document,

54
00:02:22.475 --> 00:02:23.930
or even communicate through

55
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:25.940
the use of a visual
representation.

56
00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.040
You can also use
incident management

57
00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.750
or ticketing systems.

58
00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.750
Many organizations have
incident management or

59
00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:34.580
ticketing systems that follow

60
00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:37.505
the steps outlined in
their security playbooks.

61
00:02:38.505 --> 00:02:39.290
Some scenarios are better

62
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.065
expressed by using
visual elements.

63
00:02:42.065 --> 00:02:43.910
Visuals are used to convey

64
00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:46.160
key details in the
form of graphs,

65
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.700
charts, videos, or
other visual effects.

66
00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:51.590
This allows stakeholders to view

67
00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:55.415
a pictorial representation
of what is being explained.

68
00:02:55.415 --> 00:02:57.590
Visual dashboards
can help you tell

69
00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.125
a full security story
to stakeholders.

70
00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:01.655
Later in this course,

71
00:03:01.655 --> 00:03:03.890
you'll have an opportunity
to learn how to use

72
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:07.205
Google Sheets to create
a visual security story.

73
00:03:07.205 --> 00:03:09.140
That's going to be fun!

74
00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.080
A security professional
who knows how to tell

75
00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:15.590
a compelling and concise
security story can help

76
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.570
stakeholders make
decisions about

77
00:03:17.570 --> 00:03:20.050
the best ways to
respond to an incident.

78
00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:22.190
Ideally, you want to be

79
00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:23.915
someone that make
stakeholders' jobs

80
00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:26.660
easier, and communicating
effectively

81
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.640
will certainly help you do that.

82
00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.725
Coming up, we'll continue

83
00:03:30.725 --> 00:03:34.470
our discussion about
communicating with stakeholders.
