1
00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:04.410
Let's discuss the hierarchy
within an organization.

2
00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.810
It goes from you, the analyst,

3
00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.500
to management, all the
way up to executives.

4
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:14.340
Hierarchy is a great way to
understand stakeholders.

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:16.230
A stakeholder is defined as

6
00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:18.120
an individual or group that has

7
00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.710
an interest in the decisions or

8
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.960
activities of an organization.

9
00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:24.000
This is important
for your role as

10
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.610
an entry-level analyst
because the decisions

11
00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.920
made on a day-to-day basis by

12
00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.740
stakeholders will impact
how you do your job.

13
00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:34.410
Let's focus on stakeholders
who have an interest

14
00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.325
in the daily choices
analysts make.

15
00:00:37.325 --> 00:00:39.390
After all, you may be

16
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.995
asked to communicate
your findings to them.

17
00:00:41.995 --> 00:00:45.260
So let's learn a little
bit more about who they

18
00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.859
are and the roles they play
in regards to security.

19
00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:51.890
Security threats, risks,

20
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.765
and vulnerabilities can affect

21
00:00:53.765 --> 00:00:56.660
an entire company's
operations from

22
00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.910
financial implications
to the loss

23
00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:01.625
of customer data and trust,

24
00:01:01.625 --> 00:01:05.330
the impact of security
incidents are limitless.

25
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:08.060
Each stakeholder has
a responsibility

26
00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.710
to provide input on

27
00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.140
the various decisions
and activities of

28
00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.790
the security team and

29
00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.135
how to best protect
the organization.

30
00:01:17.135 --> 00:01:19.790
There are many stakeholders
that pay close attention to

31
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.215
the security of critical
organizational assets and data.

32
00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:27.845
We're going to focus on
five of those stakeholders:

33
00:01:27.845 --> 00:01:31.445
risk managers; the Chief
Executive Officer,

34
00:01:31.445 --> 00:01:33.095
also known as the CEO;

35
00:01:33.095 --> 00:01:35.120
the Chief Financial Officer,

36
00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.950
also known as the CFO;

37
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.980
the Chief Information
Security Officer,

38
00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.129
or CISO; and operation managers.

39
00:01:43.129 --> 00:01:47.110
Let's discuss each of these
stakeholders in more detail.

40
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.230
Risk managers are important in

41
00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:50.915
an organization
because they help

42
00:01:50.915 --> 00:01:53.060
identify risks and manage

43
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.340
the response to
security incidents.

44
00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:58.054
They also notify the
legal department

45
00:01:58.054 --> 00:02:01.415
regarding regulatory issues
that need to be addressed.

46
00:02:01.415 --> 00:02:05.120
Additionally, risk managers
inform the organization's

47
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.030
public relations team in
case there is a need to

48
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.380
publish public communications
regarding an incident.

49
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.705
Next, is the Chief
Executive Officer,

50
00:02:14.705 --> 00:02:16.610
also known as the CEO.

51
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.245
This is the highest ranking
person in an organization.

52
00:02:20.245 --> 00:02:22.160
CEOs are responsible for

53
00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.860
financial and
managerial decisions.

54
00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:27.500
They also have an
obligation to report to

55
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.235
shareholders and manage the
operations of a company.

56
00:02:31.235 --> 00:02:35.840
So naturally, security is a
top priority for the CEO.

57
00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.155
Now, let's discuss the
Chief Financial Officer,

58
00:02:39.155 --> 00:02:41.075
known as the CFO.

59
00:02:41.075 --> 00:02:43.670
CFOs are senior executives

60
00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.230
responsible for managing

61
00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:47.855
the financial operations
of a company.

62
00:02:47.855 --> 00:02:50.570
They are concerned
about security from

63
00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.820
a financial
standpoint because of

64
00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.895
the potential costs of an
incident to the business.

65
00:02:55.895 --> 00:02:59.390
They are also interested in
the costs associated with

66
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.400
tools and strategies that are

67
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.525
necessary to combat
security incidents.

68
00:03:05.525 --> 00:03:08.480
Another stakeholder with an
interest in security is

69
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:12.565
the Chief Information
Security Officer, or CISO.

70
00:03:12.565 --> 00:03:15.590
CISOs are high-level executives

71
00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:17.210
responsible for developing

72
00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:19.865
an organization's
security architecture

73
00:03:19.865 --> 00:03:23.170
and conducting risk
analysis and system audits.

74
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.340
They're also tasked
with creating

75
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:28.525
security and business
continuity plans.

76
00:03:29.525 --> 00:03:32.205
Last, we have
operations managers.

77
00:03:32.205 --> 00:03:34.430
Operations managers oversee

78
00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.410
security professionals to help

79
00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.090
identify and safeguard

80
00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:40.870
an organization from
security threats.

81
00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:43.100
These individuals
often work directly

82
00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.110
with analysts as
the first line of

83
00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:47.630
defense when it comes to
protecting the company from

84
00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:50.725
threats, risks, and
vulnerabilities.

85
00:03:50.725 --> 00:03:53.270
They are also generally
responsible for

86
00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:56.275
the daily maintenance
of security operations.

87
00:03:57.275 --> 00:04:00.110
As an entry-level analyst
at a large organization,

88
00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.520
it's unlikely that you'll

89
00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.950
communicate directly
with the risk manager,

90
00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:07.300
CEO, CFO, or the CISO.

91
00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.655
However, the operations
manager will likely

92
00:04:10.655 --> 00:04:12.440
ask you to create communications

93
00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.455
to share with those individuals.

94
00:04:15.455 --> 00:04:16.950
Coming up, we'll
focus a bit more on

95
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.590
stakeholders and how to

96
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.390
effectively
communicate with them.
