00:00:01.090 --> 00:00:04.942
In this video,
we're going to have a bit of fun!

2
00:00:04.942 --> 00:00:07.920
We'll create a visual security story.

3
00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:09.669
Here's the scenario:

4
00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:14.950
The operations manager, one of the
stakeholders we previously discussed, has

5
00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.537
been informed that the Chief Information
Security Officer, also known as the CISO,

6
00:00:20.537 --> 00:00:25.300
wants to know how many employees
are often clicking on phishing emails.

7
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.978
The goal is to identify which five
departments click on those emails most often.

8
00:00:30.978 --> 00:00:35.843
An investigation reveals that the five
departments that most frequently

9
00:00:35.843 --> 00:00:40.315
click on phishing emails are: human
resources, customer service,

10
00:00:40.315 --> 00:00:45.710
global security, media relations,
and professional development.

11
00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.780
Based on this information,
the security team can create a visual

12
00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:55.400
representation of the data to share with
the operations manager and the CISO.

13
00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.851
Those stakeholders and

14
00:00:56.851 --> 00:01:02.340
the security team can then work together
to determine how to address the issue.

15
00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.985
There are many different platforms
available that can be used to create and

16
00:01:06.985 --> 00:01:09.750
share visual stories of data.

17
00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.311
Apache OpenOffice is a free, open-source
office suite that allows users

18
00:01:14.311 --> 00:01:18.830
to create spreadsheets and
other visual representations.

19
00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.460
Another no cost option is Google Sheets.

20
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.800
Today, we'll enter our
data into Google Sheets.

21
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:30.790
Then, we'll create a bar chart
visualization to develop the data story.

22
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:35.060
If you don't have a Google account,
you'll need to create one.

23
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.240
Let's start by demonstrating
how to create an account.

24
00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.539
First, go to Google.com

25
00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:45.539
And click on: Sign in

26
00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:47.822
Click: Create account

27
00:01:48.822 --> 00:01:50.822
And select: For my personal use

28
00:01:51.822 --> 00:01:56.030
Then, complete each step to
create your personal account.

29
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:00.681
Now that you've created your
Google account, it's time for us to begin

30
00:02:00.681 --> 00:02:05.609
creating our Google Sheets
bar chart visualization.

31
00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:09.854
Click: the dots menu in
the top right corner

32
00:02:10.854 --> 00:02:12.720

46
00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:31.149
Then, select: the rows and
columns containing headers, department names,

47
00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:33.097
and data.

48
00:03:34.097 --> 00:03:36.097
Click: Insert at the top of the sheet

49
00:03:37.097 --> 00:03:38.570
Select: Chart

50
00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:43.570
In the Chart editor menu,
click: Chart type drop-down menu,

51
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:46.513
scroll down to the bar chart options.

52
00:03:47.513 --> 00:03:49.031
Then, select: the first bar chart

53
00:03:50.031 --> 00:03:53.196
In the Chart editor menu,
click: Customize

54
00:03:54.196 --> 00:03:59.330
Then, click on the: Chart & axis
titles section.

55
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:04.221
Now, update the title to read something
like: Clicked phishing emails

56
00:04:04.221 --> 00:04:08.271
by department, or
another title related to the data.

57
00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.760
Then, Click on the: x icon at the top of
the chart editor to close the editor menu.

58
00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:19.413
Great job creating your
first visual security story!

59
00:04:19.413 --> 00:04:24.164
Creating visual stories of data allow
security team members to convey

60
00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:27.080
essential information to stakeholders,

61
00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:31.433
so issues can be communicated in
a meaningful and understandable way.

62
00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:36.317
These data stories can also help promote
a better understanding of issues that

63
00:04:36.317 --> 00:04:41.127
exist within an organization and
allow decision makers to determine how to

64
00:04:41.127 --> 00:04:44.901
address security issues that
put the organization at risk.
