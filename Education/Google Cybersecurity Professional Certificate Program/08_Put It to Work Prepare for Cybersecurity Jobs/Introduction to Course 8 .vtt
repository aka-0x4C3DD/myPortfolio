00:00:01.342 --> 00:00:04.203
Hello, and welcome to the course!

2
00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:07.688
I'm Dion, a Program Manager at Google.

3
00:00:07.688 --> 00:00:11.031
I've worked in security for
the past five years in

4
00:00:11.031 --> 00:00:15.500
areas ranging from risk management
to insider threat detection.

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.817
I'll be your first
instructor in this course.

6
00:00:19.817 --> 00:00:23.678
As a security analyst, you'll help
protect the assets of the organization you

7
00:00:23.678 --> 00:00:24.362
work for,

8
00:00:24.362 --> 00:00:29.099
including tangible, or
physical, assets such as software and

9
00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:33.553
network devices, as well as
intangible assets, like PII,

10
00:00:33.553 --> 00:00:36.885
copyrights, and intellectual property.

11
00:00:36.885 --> 00:00:41.649
Imagine if this kind of sensitive
information were to be exposed by a threat

12
00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.053
actor! It would be devastating
to the reputation and

13
00:00:45.053 --> 00:00:50.367
financial stability of the organization
and the people the organization serves.

14
00:00:51.367 --> 00:00:54.970
In previous courses, we discussed
a variety of topics that are relevant to

15
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:56.710
the security profession,

16
00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:01.819
including: core security concepts;
frameworks and controls;

17
00:01:01.819 --> 00:01:05.982
threats, risks, and
vulnerabilities; networks;

18
00:01:05.982 --> 00:01:10.911
incident detection and response;
and programming basics.

19
00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:16.029
Now it's time to put all of these core
security concepts to practical use.

20
00:01:17.029 --> 00:01:20.457
In this course, we'll further
explore how to protect assets and

21
00:01:20.457 --> 00:01:22.233
communicate incidents.

22
00:01:22.233 --> 00:01:24.285
Then, we'll discuss when and

23
00:01:24.285 --> 00:01:29.679
how to escalate incidents to protect
an organization's assets and data.

24
00:01:29.679 --> 00:01:34.714
We'll also cover how to communicate
effectively to influence stakeholders'

25
00:01:34.714 --> 00:01:36.826
decisions related to security.

26
00:01:37.826 --> 00:01:41.796
After that, Emily, your instructor for the
second part of this course will introduce

27
00:01:41.796 --> 00:01:46.416
some reliable resources that will help
you engage with the security community

28
00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:49.227
after you complete this
certificate program.

29
00:01:50.227 --> 00:01:54.942
And finally, we'll cover how to find,
prepare for, and apply for security jobs.

30
00:01:54.942 --> 00:01:58.878
This will include discussions about
how to create a compelling resume and

31
00:01:58.878 --> 00:02:01.682
tips to help you throughout
the interview process.

32
00:02:02.682 --> 00:02:04.662
When I started my first
security-based role,

33
00:02:04.662 --> 00:02:09.506
I was excited to be hired at Google
to protect information and devices.

34
00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:13.938
I was also happy to be a part of a broader
team that I could learn from and

35
00:02:13.938 --> 00:02:15.629
reach out to for support.

36
00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.300
My team helped me grow my expertise, and

37
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:21.642
I'm proud of my contribution
to our projects.

38
00:02:22.642 --> 00:02:26.318
By the end of this course,
you'll have had multiple opportunities to

39
00:02:26.318 --> 00:02:31.153
refine your understanding of key
security concepts, create a resume,

40
00:02:31.153 --> 00:02:34.245
build confidence in your
interview skills, and

41
00:02:34.245 --> 00:02:39.416
even participate in an artificial
intelligence, or AI, generated interview.

42
00:02:39.416 --> 00:02:42.804
The security profession is
such an amazing field, and

43
00:02:42.804 --> 00:02:45.426
I'm looking forward to you joining it!

44
00:02:45.426 --> 00:02:49.555
I have one question for you:
Are you ready to get started?
