00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.067
Earlier we discussed the importance of
staying up-to-date on security trends and news.

2
00:00:06.067 --> 00:00:10.426
In this video, we're going to share ways
to establish and advance your career in

3
00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:14.216
security by connecting with people
who are already in the industry.

4
00:00:15.216 --> 00:00:19.237
Social media is a great way to connect
to other security professionals in the industry.

5
00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:23.670
However, it's important to be mindful of
the information you share on your social media

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.549
page and when responding to
messages from people you don't know.

7
00:00:27.549 --> 00:00:32.087
With that in mind, let's discuss ways
to effectively use social media to establish

8
00:00:32.087 --> 00:00:34.879
or advance your security career.

9
00:00:35.879 --> 00:00:38.313
One way to use social
media is to follow, or

10
00:00:38.313 --> 00:00:42.767
read the posts of, leaders
in the security industry.

11
00:00:42.767 --> 00:00:48.587
Chief Information Security Officers, for
example, are great individuals to follow.

12
00:00:48.587 --> 00:00:52.470
They often post interviews they've
done in the security space and

13
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:55.397
share articles they've read or
contributed to.

14
00:00:56.397 --> 00:00:58.596
Here's a question you
might be asking yourself:

15
00:00:58.596 --> 00:01:01.498
How can I find CISOs to
follow on social media?

16
00:01:01.498 --> 00:01:05.667
The best way would be to conduct an
internet search for the name of the CISO of

17
00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:10.185
a popular organization or an organization
you're interested in working for.

18
00:01:10.185 --> 00:01:15.128
After you find their name, you can simply
go to a social media site to look them up.

19
00:01:15.128 --> 00:01:19.657
Ideally, you want to use LinkedIn® when
following security professionals.

20
00:01:19.657 --> 00:01:24.362
That's because the LinkedIn® platform
focuses on connecting professionals with other

21
00:01:24.362 --> 00:01:27.301
professionals in the same or
similar field.

22
00:01:28.301 --> 00:01:30.153
Another way to use social
media to establish or

23
00:01:30.153 --> 00:01:34.978
advance your career in the security
industry is to connect with other security analysts

24
00:01:34.978 --> 00:01:37.702
currently employed in the field.

25
00:01:37.702 --> 00:01:42.856
On social networks like LinkedIn®,
you can find security professionals

26
00:01:42.856 --> 00:01:47.681
by searching for cybersecurity
analysts, or a similar search term,

27
00:01:47.681 --> 00:01:53.355
then filtering for people and people
who talk about #cybersecurity.

28
00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:56.987
Once you've found other professionals
you'd like to connect with,

29
00:01:56.987 --> 00:02:00.321
you can send a connection request
with a brief comment such as:

30
00:02:00.321 --> 00:02:04.646
Hi, I'd like to connect to
learn more about why you became

31
00:02:04.646 --> 00:02:09.163
interested in security and
your experiences as an analyst.

32
00:02:09.163 --> 00:02:12.952
Additionally, you can set your
filter to locate events and

33
00:02:12.952 --> 00:02:17.139
groups that focus on security
related topics that interest you.

34
00:02:18.139 --> 00:02:20.165
While social media platforms
like LinkedIn® are excellent for

35
00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:21.859
connecting with professionals,

36
00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:26.540
some people are more comfortable with
being active on social media than others.

37
00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.994
For those of us who aren't very active
on social media, there are other ways to connect

38
00:02:30.994 --> 00:02:35.323
with security professionals or
find mentors in the industry.

39
00:02:36.323 --> 00:02:40.516
Joining different security associations
is a good way to connect with others.

40
00:02:40.516 --> 00:02:42.898
There are many associations out there, so

41
00:02:42.898 --> 00:02:47.208
you're going to have to do a little bit of
research to find the best ones for you.

42
00:02:47.208 --> 00:02:51.600
Here's a tip! In your internet
search engine, type:

43
00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.677
cybersecurity industry associations.

44
00:02:53.677 --> 00:02:57.820
This search term will populate
a variety of different associations, so

45
00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.620
be sure to select ones that align
with your professional goals.

46
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:05.538
Now that we've discussed ways to
engage with the security community,

47
00:03:05.538 --> 00:03:10.082
consider following a CISO on LinkedIn®,
connecting with other analysts, or

48
00:03:10.082 --> 00:03:13.463
searching for
cybersecurity organizations to join.

49
00:03:13.463 --> 00:03:16.205
That's all for now.
I'll meet you in the next video!
