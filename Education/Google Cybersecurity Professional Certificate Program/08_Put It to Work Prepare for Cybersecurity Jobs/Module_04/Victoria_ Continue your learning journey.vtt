00:00:04.254 --> 00:00:06.984
I'm Victoria,
I'm a security engineer at Google.

2
00:00:06.984 --> 00:00:10.475
When I first applied for
a cybersecurity job, I felt overwhelmed.

3
00:00:10.475 --> 00:00:15.283
I was not a traditionally educated
in computer science applicant,

4
00:00:15.283 --> 00:00:17.569
I actually majored in biology.

5
00:00:17.569 --> 00:00:22.098
So anytime a recruiter saw my resume,
I would kind of get this little like fear that

6
00:00:22.098 --> 00:00:25.948
they would see that bio major and
say, why are you even applying?

7
00:00:25.948 --> 00:00:28.492
And just immediately disregard my resume.

8
00:00:28.492 --> 00:00:31.716
I would consider the team that
I work on to be very diverse.

9
00:00:31.716 --> 00:00:34.717
We have a lot of different people
from different backgrounds.

10
00:00:34.717 --> 00:00:38.536
One of the benefits that I feel from
having a diverse team is that you can

11
00:00:38.536 --> 00:00:41.275
have these different
perspectives on a problem.

12
00:00:41.275 --> 00:00:43.820
That if all of you had
the same background for,

13
00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:46.308
you might not come up
with this new solution.

14
00:00:46.308 --> 00:00:50.032
Having someone that's new to the team,
maybe new to the industry, and

15
00:00:50.032 --> 00:00:54.577
having that perspective can really help to
make things more accessible for everyone.

16
00:00:54.577 --> 00:00:58.868
It's important to continue to learn in
the field of cybersecurity because things

17
00:00:58.868 --> 00:00:59.997
change all the time.

18
00:00:59.997 --> 00:01:05.199
What was once a big threat a few years ago
might not be the same as it is for today.

19
00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.539
Trying to keep pace with how things
are changing all the time is

20
00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:12.634
something that is a core
part of my job role.

21
00:01:12.634 --> 00:01:16.429
To support my continued education
in security, I take courses,

22
00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:21.122
try to get certificates if I can along the
way, but a lot of it is just keeping up on

23
00:01:21.122 --> 00:01:25.400
current industry news, whether that be
a new blog post about a breach that

24
00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.841
has happened or a detailed analysis of
a new malware that has been released.

25
00:01:29.841 --> 00:01:32.782
Try to keep at least
a surface level knowledge of

26
00:01:32.782 --> 00:01:35.216
the different trends in the industry.

27
00:01:35.216 --> 00:01:39.051
I often go to BSides Conferences.

28
00:01:39.051 --> 00:01:41.323
These are smaller and
locally organized conferences.

29
00:01:41.323 --> 00:01:45.670
So you have more of a chance to interact
with your local security community, which

30
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.221
is something you wouldn't get at a huge
conference like, say, DEFCON or Black hat.

31
00:01:50.221 --> 00:01:54.483
Meeting people locally is a great way
to see what's out there in your area,

32
00:01:54.483 --> 00:01:58.747
and meet other folks that are local
that you can talk to more consistently,

33
00:01:58.747 --> 00:02:00.996
that are also interested in security.

34
00:02:00.996 --> 00:02:02.326
Before I got into my role,

35
00:02:02.326 --> 00:02:05.724
I wish that I knew that it was okay
that you don't know everything.

36
00:02:05.724 --> 00:02:07.173
You don't have to know everything.

37
00:02:07.173 --> 00:02:11.578
You have teammates and other people that
can help you with areas that you're weak

38
00:02:11.578 --> 00:02:16.176
in, so don't feel stressed if you don't
know everything there is about security,

39
00:02:16.176 --> 00:02:17.362
because no one does.

40
00:02:17.362 --> 00:02:19.642
Working in security is a lot of fun.

41
00:02:19.642 --> 00:02:21.207
A lot of things can happen.

42
00:02:21.207 --> 00:02:23.135
It's never the same day to day.

43
00:02:23.135 --> 00:02:26.343
So if you like things that are dynamic and
always changing,

44
00:02:26.343 --> 00:02:28.600
then security is the right field for you.
