00:00:00.861 --> 00:00:02.268
Great job!

2
00:00:02.268 --> 00:00:06.748
Now you've had an opportunity to learn about
different ways to stay engaged with

3
00:00:06.748 --> 00:00:08.293
the security community.

4
00:00:08.293 --> 00:00:11.096
Let's take a moment to
review what we've covered.

5
00:00:12.096 --> 00:00:15.348
First, we identified
reliable security resources.

6
00:00:15.348 --> 00:00:20.477
Then, we discussed different ways to
engage with the security community.

7
00:00:20.477 --> 00:00:25.647
We also explored the usefulness of social
media to connect with other security professionals

8
00:00:25.647 --> 00:00:30.209
and stay informed
about current topics of interest.

9
00:00:30.209 --> 00:00:35.078
Finally, we shared ways to establish
and advance a career in security,

10
00:00:35.078 --> 00:00:40.856
including following a CISO on social media
or joining a professional organization.

11
00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:43.180
We've come a long way in this journey.

12
00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.661
You should be proud of your progress and
how far you've come.

13
00:00:46.661 --> 00:00:48.366
I'm certainly proud of you.

14
00:00:48.366 --> 00:00:52.245
In the final section of this course,
we'll take the time to prepare you for

15
00:00:52.245 --> 00:00:54.628
the job search and interviewing process.

16
00:00:54.628 --> 00:00:56.248
How exciting is that!?
