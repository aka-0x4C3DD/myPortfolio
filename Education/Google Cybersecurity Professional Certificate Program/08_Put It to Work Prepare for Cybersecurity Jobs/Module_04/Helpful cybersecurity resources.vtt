00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.030
As we approach the
end of our program,

2
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.980
it's important to start
thinking about ways

3
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.425
to engage with the
security community.

4
00:00:07.425 --> 00:00:09.345
As the industry evolves,

5
00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:11.310
it's essential to
stay up-to-date on

6
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.605
the latest security
trends and news.

7
00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:15.659
Let's discuss a
few good resources

8
00:00:15.659 --> 00:00:17.790
for you to review periodically.

9
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:20.654
What excites me about
the security profession

10
00:00:20.654 --> 00:00:23.775
is the constant evolution
of the industry.

11
00:00:23.775 --> 00:00:26.835
Take the OWASP top
10 for example.

12
00:00:26.835 --> 00:00:28.435
Earlier in the program,

13
00:00:28.435 --> 00:00:30.095
we discussed the
fact that this is

14
00:00:30.095 --> 00:00:31.820
a globally recognized standard

15
00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:33.920
awareness document that lists

16
00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.485
the top 10 most
critical security risks

17
00:00:36.485 --> 00:00:38.195
to web applications.

18
00:00:38.195 --> 00:00:41.460
This list is updated
every three to four years,

19
00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.010
so it's a great example of

20
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.370
the evolving nature
of the field.

21
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:48.500

education beyond

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.320
