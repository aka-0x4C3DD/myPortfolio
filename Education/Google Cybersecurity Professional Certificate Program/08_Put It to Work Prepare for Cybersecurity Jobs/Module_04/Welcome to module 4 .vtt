00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:02.200
Welcome back!

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:03.236
I'm Emily, and

3
00:00:03.236 --> 00:00:07.920
I've been working in security education
at Google for nearly nine years.

4
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.385
My team works closely with our remarkable
security experts to craft innovative and

5
00:00:13.385 --> 00:00:15.806
engaging educational solutions for

6
00:00:15.806 --> 00:00:19.097
our workforce to keep
security at the forefront.

7
00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:20.915
I'll be your instructor for

8
00:00:20.915 --> 00:00:25.624
the remainder of the course to discuss
important career-related topics,

9
00:00:25.624 --> 00:00:29.071
such as
how to engage with the security community,

10
00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:34.770
find jobs in the security field, create a
resume, and navigate the interview process.

11
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.929
We're approaching the end
of the certificate program,

12
00:00:37.929 --> 00:00:40.530
what an incredible journey it's been so
far.

13
00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.461
We've discussed a lot up to this point,
including incident detection and escalation,

14
00:00:45.461 --> 00:00:50.871
and the roles that stakeholders
play in protecting an organization.

15
00:00:50.871 --> 00:00:55.357
We've also explored the sensitive nature
of the communications we share and

16
00:00:55.357 --> 00:00:59.310
strategies for conveying critical
information to stakeholders.

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.180
But does the learning stop now that we're
approaching the end of the program?

18
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:04.716
Absolutely not!

19
00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:08.716
In the following videos,
we'll identify reliable security

20
00:01:08.716 --> 00:01:15.110
resources you can use to stay
up-to-date on security news and trends.

21
00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.547
Then, we'll share some ways to become
involved with the security community.

22
00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:24.294
We'll end with a discussion
about how to establish and advance

23
00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:26.420
a career in security.

24
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.241
Coming up, we'll highlight some great
resources to help you stay current on

25
00:01:30.241 --> 00:01:32.550
