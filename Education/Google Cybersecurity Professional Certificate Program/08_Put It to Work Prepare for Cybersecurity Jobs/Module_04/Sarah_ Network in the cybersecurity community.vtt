Hi everyone, I'm Sarah and
I am a senior program manager on Google's

3
00:00:08.237 --> 00:00:10.925
privacy safety and
security engineering team.

4
00:00:10.925 --> 00:00:14.138
One of the communities I'm most
involved in is a group called

5
00:00:14.138 --> 00:00:15.528
Women in Cybersecurity.

6
00:00:15.528 --> 00:00:19.663
And so I found that community really
helpful to me when I first joined because,

7
00:00:19.663 --> 00:00:21.995
I felt super new and slightly overwhelmed.

8
00:00:21.995 --> 00:00:23.383
I listened to a lot of their webinars,

9
00:00:23.383 --> 00:00:25.060
I kind of look in on
their forum board, now

10
00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.198
I always attend their conference and
actually I just joined their board,

11
00:00:28.198 --> 00:00:29.623
which I'm super excited about.

12
00:00:29.623 --> 00:00:32.573
One of the things that I find
most exciting is that ability

13
00:00:32.573 --> 00:00:35.348
to be within cybersecurity
without this long history.

14
00:00:35.348 --> 00:00:38.954
I don't have a computer science degree, I
don't have a masters, I don't have a PhD.

15
00:00:38.954 --> 00:00:42.891
But through networking and figuring
out where my areas of interest lie,

16
00:00:42.891 --> 00:00:47.235
I actually was able to get into this field
and grow and advance within this field.

17
00:00:47.235 --> 00:00:51.548
I've really found that, it is a welcoming
community that is looking and

18
00:00:51.548 --> 00:00:53.679
needs more people to be a part of it.

19
00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:58.514
There's a huge range of people that are
coming into this again with the big wide

20
00:00:58.514 --> 00:01:01.810
range of experiences, and
I think everyone has found or

21
00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.859
is exploring what their passions
and the areas they want to dig in.

22
00:01:05.859 --> 00:01:09.418
Networking is really important to be able
to meet peers who might be at the same

23
00:01:09.418 --> 00:01:12.235
stage as you or people who might
have hiring opportunities.

24
00:01:12.235 --> 00:01:16.013
I definitely recommend connecting with
your peers in the certificate program,

25
00:01:16.013 --> 00:01:19.255
it's a great form of motivation for
yourself and to motivate others.

26
00:01:19.255 --> 00:01:23.553
Having these points where you're either
talking about the specific content or

27
00:01:23.553 --> 00:01:26.246
just doing a check in is
going to be really helpful for

28
00:01:26.246 --> 00:01:28.693
you to continue through
the course program

29
00:01:28.693 --> 00:01:31.440
and to help others continue through
the course program as well.

30
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.025
There's also the series of conferences
that exist called BSides. So

31
00:01:35.025 --> 00:01:38.369
these are super informal security
conferences that take place in

32
00:01:38.369 --> 00:01:41.915
communities around the world.
Many also have virtual components.

33
00:01:41.915 --> 00:01:44.159
They're kind of a fun
place to meet people.

34
00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.862
A big piece of advice is,
to not let yourself get overwhelmed, and

35
00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:50.016
don't feel nervous that you don't know
all the answers, because you know what,

36
00:01:50.016 --> 00:01:51.334
nobody knows all the answers.

37
00:01:51.334 --> 00:01:55.467
It's okay to come into this with not
a ton of background in computer science,

38
00:01:55.467 --> 00:01:56.814
not a ton of background

39
00:01:56.814 --> 00:02:00.001
in tech and still,
you will bring value to the field.
