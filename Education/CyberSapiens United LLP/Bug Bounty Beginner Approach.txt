git clone https://github.com/six2dez/reconftw
cd reconftw/
./install.sh
./reconftw.sh -d target.com -r

ADVANCE RECON :

  - STEP 1 ( TO FIND SUBDOMAINS )

  - You need two tools
  - Subfinder / Sublist3r / amass / assetfinder

		subfinder -d domain.com -o subsactive.txt

		subfinder -d domain.com |httpx 200 |tee subsall.txt

		(Pro tip -You can also check for subdomain takeover)

STEP 2 waybackurls(tomnomnom) | gauplus

STEP 3 (gf)

	- cat way.txt | gf xss |tee xss.txt
	- cat way.txt | gf sqli |tee sql.txt
	- cat way.txt | gf redirect |tee redirect.txt
